/**
 * The shared write-path scaffolding (`engine/src/df/build.ts`) — the contract the seven
 * per-format builders rest on, asserted directly rather than only through them.
 *
 * Every claim here is one the format builders depend on: that a container's index
 * is handed back as it is allocated (every cross-reference in these formats is an
 * index), that a reserved container's bytes stay writable after the fact (a header
 * is filled in once the things it points at exist), that a gap reads back as a
 * gap, and that the palette block puts the channel value where the reader looks
 * for it.
