/**
 * The game host: what it means to *run* the game, minus the browser.
 *
 * `main.ts` is the page — canvas, input, DOM, the rAF loop. This is the layer
 * under it: the single session, the set that is currently open, and the
 * lifecycle that gets from one to the other — activating a set, prefetching
 * what it needs, booting the shipped `BOOTFILE boot()`, resuming a save.
 *
 * It exists because that lifecycle is game knowledge, not page knowledge, and
 * it used to live in `main.ts` purely because the mutable `viewer` did. Three
 * defects hid there — the theme blip, the stale scene loop across a set swap,
 * the audio-unlock desync — untestable, because the test harness could not
 * import a module that touches `document`, and so had hand-rolled its own
 * shorter `onSetChange` instead. Anything a test could contradict belongs here.
 *
 * Nothing in this file may reference `document`, `window` or WebAudio: the page
 * passes its side in as {@link HostFiles} (a file source), {@link HostUi} (five
 * notifications) and an {@link AudioSink}. Tests pass node equivalents.
