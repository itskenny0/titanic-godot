/**
 * The load remover: how long the page has spent waiting on the network
 * ([#251](https://github.com/dhobi/dreamrefactory/issues/251)).
 *
 * A speedrun timer is supposed to measure a route, and a route run in a browser
 * spends part of its wall time downloading the game. That part is not the
 * route's: the same sheet, on the same build, over a warm cache against a cold
 * one, is minutes apart with not one gesture changed. PC speedruns have long
 * since answered this with a **load remover** — the timer reads a value the game
 * sets while it loads and stops counting for as long as it is set — and a port
 * that fetches its data has the same value to read, because every byte a game
 * gets comes through one place ({@link HostFiles}) and that place already says
 * when it is waiting ({@link WireEvent}).
 *
 * It is in the engine and names no game, which is the whole of why it is here:
 * every DreamFactory port on this site fetches its disc the same way, and a
 * second copy of this arithmetic would be a second set of times nobody could
 * compare with the first.
 *
 * ## Only the NETWORK, not every fetch ([#369](https://github.com/dhobi/dreamrefactory/issues/369))
 *
 * The first version of this stopwatch ran whenever a fetch was in the air, and
 * that removes time the run really did spend. A file already in the browser's
 * memory or disk cache is not a download: it is a read, of the kind the original
 * did off a CD every time it opened a room, and the original's clock counted
 * those. Removing them would credit a route for work the game has to do
 * wherever it runs — and it made the workbench's times unaccountably faster than
 * the runner's, which is what #369 reported.
 *
 * So a fetch only stops the clock if the browser says it went to the network.
 * The browser will say ({@link LoadClockPorts.served}, Resource Timing's
 * `deliveryType`/`transferSize`), and where it will not, {@link CACHE_GRACE_MS}
 * decides on duration: nothing served out of RAM or off a local disk takes that
 * long, and no round trip is quicker.
 *
 * ## And only the fetches the game is STOPPED for
 *
 * The other half of #369, and the half that matters on a deployed page, where
 * the rip really does come over a link. `HostFiles.load` is awaited by whoever
 * called it — a set activation blocks on the room and all of its siblings and
 * casts before anything is composited — so the game is stopped for the whole of
 * it and the clock should be too. `HostFiles.provide` is the opposite: the
 * engine asked, was told "not yet", and carried on, and the file is wired into
 * the running viewer if and when it lands. The run is progressing throughout, so
 * removing that time credits a route for playing the game.
 *
 * {@link watchLoads} does that filtering, on the store's own word for it
 * ({@link WireEvent.waited}) — the store knows who is waiting and this stopwatch
 * does not. What is left here is the question of whether a wait was a DOWNLOAD.
 *
 * Where the two rules disagree with each other, the tiebreak is to COUNT the
 * time: under-removing makes a route look slower than it was, which is a number
 * nobody can be misled by, while over-removing invents a record. Every choice
 * above is that way round.
 *
 * ## Two consequences worth stating, because both look like a bug from the outside:
 * over a warm cache almost NOTHING is removed, and against a dev server on
 * loopback nothing is removed AT ALL — a `localhost` fetch is a disk read
 * wearing HTTP, and its duration is a fact about the reader's disk rather than
 * about any link. So on a dev server the load-removed time is the wall clock,
 * which is exactly what it should be: there was no network to take out. The
 * remover earns its keep on the deployed page, where the rip really does arrive
 * over a link, and over a warm cache besides — see the Warm button
 * (engine/src/web/cache-warmup.ts).
 *
 * ## Two numbers come out of it, and they are different questions:
 *
 *   - {@link LoadClock.ms} — the total, monotonic and never reset. A timer takes
 *     the DIFFERENCE between two readings, exactly as it does with the wall
 *     clock, so nothing has to be armed before a run or cleared after one.
 *   - {@link LoadClock.waiting} — whether the wire is busy at this instant, which
 *     is what a paused readout says on its face.
 *
 * The total includes the fetch still in the air, and it has to: a reading taken
 * mid-download that counted only finished fetches would say the run had spent
 * nothing on a 37 MB film that has been arriving for ten seconds, so the clock
 * would tick right through it and then jump backwards when it landed.
 *
 * Which is awkward beside the rule above, since whether a fetch went to the
 * network is only known once it has finished. {@link CACHE_GRACE_MS} is how the
 * two live together: a fetch is treated as a download once it has been open
 * longer than any cache could take, and the whole of its span is credited when
 * it closes. The only cost is that the clock pauses a beat late, and a cache hit
 * never pauses it at all.
 *
 * ## Where it is wired, and where it is read
 *
 * Whoever owns the store subscribes {@link loadClock} to it — one
 * {@link watchLoads} call per page (taoot/src/main.ts, dust/src/main.ts) — and
 * hands the total out on `window.dbg`, which is how a Playwright driver, in
 * another process entirely, reads a number measured in the page
 * (taoot/tests/speedrun/driver.ts). The in-page workbench imports the same
 * singleton directly (taoot/src/speedrun-page.ts).
 *
 * ## What it does NOT try to be
 *
 * It removes NETWORK time, not decode time, not the frame the engine spends
 * compositing a room it has just been handed. Those are the port's own cost and
 * a machine that runs them faster deserves the faster time; the wire is the one
 * part of the wall clock that says nothing about either the route or the
 * computer running it.

 * answer in two spellings, because the tidy one is newer than some browsers:
 * `deliveryType === "cache"` says it outright, and where that is missing, a zero
 * `transferSize` against a body that has a size is the long-standing way to read

 * one wins, since a basename can be fetched again after a reload.
