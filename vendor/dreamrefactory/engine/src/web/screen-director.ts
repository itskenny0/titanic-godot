/**
 * The screen, and who owns it — independent of whether the game has a room.
 *
 * This is the half of the old `SetViewer` that was never about a SET. Movies,
 * conversation close-ups, stage flats, the prop and actor layers, the fades, the
 * wipes, the CLUT, the text overlay and the "is this picture already on the
 * canvas?" check are all screen business, and none of them needs a room — but all
 * of them lived on a class whose constructor demanded a `SetFile`, so a game with
 * no SET got none of them.
 *
 * ## What that cost, before this existed
 *
 * Three workarounds in the tree, each of them the same bug wearing a different
 * hat:
 *
 *   - `GameHost.coldBoot`'s no-landing-room path opened a room it did not want
 *     with `skipOpen`, purely so the boot's films had a surface, and said so:
 *     "It still needs a room to draw INTO… Any of the game's rooms will do."
 *   - `DustFiles.serverSetNames` answers `["town.set"]` and explains that the
 *     room doubles as the movie host — the intro films were invisible for as
 *     long as it answered "none".
 *   - `paintWorldInto` already handled `viewShowing === false`. It always knew
 *     the room might be absent; nothing could reach it without one.
 *
 * *Timelapse* (1996) is what forced the issue: 465 game files across four discs
 * and not one `.SET` on any of them. Its rooms ARE stage flats, reached by
 * `gotostage(stage, region, frame)`, with the navigation graph written out as a
 * script table in each stage's own container 1 rather than as a set's turn rings.
 * So there is no room to borrow, and until this file existed that meant no
 * movies, no fades and no compositing at all.
 *
 * ## The split
 *
 * The room is a LAYER this composites, declared by {@link RoomLayer} and
 * implemented by `SetViewer`. `room` is null for a game that has none, and every
 * branch below already reads as if it might be — because it always could be.
 *
 * What stayed in `SetViewer`: the navigation state machine (rings, roads, the
 * camera, turn and walk animation, the nav drivers), the geometry of its own
 * hit-testing, the hotspot overlay and the map. What is here: everything that
 * decides what reaches the canvas, and everything that decides where a click
 * goes.
 *
 * INPUT is here too, and for the same reason: the click priority chain is a
 * SCREEN rule. A live movie takes its own clicks, a shown conversation takes its
 * own, `lockevents` freezes everything, a click made while something is running
 * is queued, and what is left goes to whatever is drawn — none of which is a
 * room's business, and all of which a game with no rooms needs. The room keeps
 * its own zone of it ({@link RoomLayer.roomClickAt}, {@link RoomLayer.roomHitTest})
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * `hittest` is the shape of the whole thing in one function, and it is what makes
 * the split obvious: a PROP first and unbounded, then the room's zone, then the
 * stage's, then "None". Only the middle step needed a room, and it took the other
 * three down with it.

   * Who owns the screen right now, front to back — the painter's priority, kept
   * in one place because it is the same rule the INPUT path keeps (the viewer's
   * click dispatch: a live movie beats even a suspended conversation) and the two
   * had drifted.
   *
   * A movie owns the screen outright. It carries its own palette and its own
   * pixels, and a fade is not a layer over it — so a fade-out the script left
   * standing must not survive into it. TAOOT's demo Smethells briefing is where
   * that showed: `screentoblack("puppet", 15); puppetvisible(false);
   * playmovie("penote.mov")` — no `blackscreen()` between, so the held snapshot
   * kept the screen and penote.mov played, clickable, behind a black rectangle.
   * The full game has the same shape twice: the darkroom's
   * `playmovie("photobox.mov")` (PHOTO.STG 0012) and the wireless portrait
   * (WIRELESS.SHP 0120).
   *
   * **held** is the frame after a movie, and it is the one state in which the
   * screen belongs to nobody. `playmovie` in TI.EXE returns having freed its
   * buffers and restored nothing (`0x448b00`'s exit path, `0x44969e`–
   * `0x4496c7`): the clip's last frame is simply still in the framebuffer, and
   * the palette is still the clip's, until a script says otherwise. Ours handed
   * the screen straight back to `world` on the frame the movie ended, and with
   * the script resuming a rAF later that is one fully-lit frame of the room
   * between a movie and whatever the script does next — #209, measured at
   * exactly one 16 ms frame of the un-bombed apartment between `bedex.mov` and
   * `ocredits.mov`. `fade.pendingReveal` already means precisely "a movie ended
   * and nothing has said what the screen should look like", so it is also the
   * answer to "is the screen still the movie's": hold until the script draws
   * (`blackscreen`, `clut`, either fade — all of which clear it) or falls quiet
   * (tickFade). The boot is the long case and it is the original's: `boot()`
   * plays `playmode.mov` and then loads the cast, four shops and a stage before
   * `advanceday` reaches `datebed.mov`, with no screen statement in between, so
   * the menu's last frame is what stays up through the load.

  /**
   * A TURN: both pictures move, at the same rate, in the same direction.
   *
   * The wipe below is subtractive — the arriving screen is already painted, so
   * only the part of the leaving one it has not uncovered has to be put back. A
   * turn cannot work that way, because the arriving picture MOVES too: what you
   * see is a strip of it at one edge, sliding in as the old one leaves by the
   * other. Hence its own routine.
   *
   * ## What the original does, from `tl.exe`
   *
   * `visualeffect` dispatches on the effect id through a 21-entry jump table at
   * 0x447c18 (ids 24001..24021, a slot each), and its one caller (0x44a5ab)
   * hands every effect the SCREEN rect, 0x465f30 — the same rect the blits clip
   * against — with the step count clamped 1..1000.
   *
   * The four turn slots are the only ones that call 0x448cb0, and 0x448cb0 clips
   * BOTH of its rects against that screen rect, which is what a copy has to do
   * when source and destination are one surface. The wipes never touch it: they
   * call the offscreen-to-screen blit 0x448c20 twice. So each pass of a turn is
   * a screen-to-screen block move of `width - di` columns — the picture sliding
   * sideways — followed by one `di`-wide strip of the arriving picture into the
   * edge that move vacated, with `di = travel / steps + 1` (0x44868b).
   *
   * ## Where the strip comes from
   *
   * The source is a zero-width CURSOR that widens by `di` a pass, and where it
   * starts is the part worth writing down, because it explains the art.
   *
   * A full turn starts it at the arriving picture's own edge. A HALF turn starts
   * it a quarter of the way in: `turnhalfleft` computes `half = width / 2` (the
   * travel), then `half / 2` again, and does `P.right -= width/4` followed by
   * `P.left = P.right` (0x448b66..0x448b73) — a cursor at column 480 of 640,
   * sweeping left across 320 columns to land on 160.
   *
   * Which is exactly where the art is. A mid-turn flat — frametype `1`, what
   * `framename("1", …)` builds — is not a whole picture: measured across
   * `i001.stg`, every one is 320 content columns at x=160..479 of a 640 canvas,
   * blank either side. The artists centred it because the engine's cursor starts
   * a quarter in, and a port that sourced from the edge would slide that blank
   * margin across the screen instead of the picture.

    // `"patty 1"` cannot be played at all the other way round: its `doll1` and
    // `dial` regions between them cover the left half of the doll sprite, so the
    // matryoshka — whose whole interaction is clicking its left half to open it
    // (PATTY.SHP 0003) — was unclickable, which is where this was found.
    //
    // The regions still get everything no prop's opaque pixels are under, which
    // is how `doll1` is reached at all: the doll is invisible until the
    // combination is right, so the region takes the click, and once the doll is
    // out it covers its own region. Same shape in the fusebox, where `fusedoor`

    // let a player flip fuses through a shut door.
