 * moved, an update is a few string comparisons and NO writes at all, which is the
 * ordinary case — the game spends most of its time being looked at.
 *
 * Measured in the browser with a MutationObserver over the list, 4 s a sample:
 *
 *  * a room standing still, 16 refresh ticks: **0 mutations**
 *  * one global moved: **2** — its number, and its highlight coming on
 *  * all 30 of that room's rows on screen: **20**, and every one of them the

 *    again; filter it to `sec` and `secframe` and it is 4, one a second each.
