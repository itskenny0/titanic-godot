   * A key while the movie owns the screen. Returns true if it aborted it.
   *
   * A key during a movie is the movie's to interpret, not the host's and not
   * the script's: the original has ONE event queue, and whichever modal loop
   * is running pops from it (the main interactive loop takes anything, TI.EXE
   * 0x431c43; a text prompt takes keys only, 0x440756; the movie loop takes
   * keys and its own kinds, 0x44a16b). So while a movie plays, the key never
   * reaches the script chain — the movie consumed it — and the abort rule
   * lives here rather than at whatever routed the keystroke in.
   *
   * The rule (TI.EXE 0x44a460, the movie's key filter): the event must be a
   * FRESH keydown carrying the 0x1fa0 marker — set for ESC and for any key
   * held with Ctrl, which is {@link special} — and its character must be
   * `.` (what the window proc translates ESC to) or `q`. Both land on the
   * same instruction: `return movieHeader[0x18] & 1`, i.e. {@link
   * MovFile.keySkips}. Ctrl+0..9 and Ctrl+T are the only other keys with
   * cases and neither aborts; an auto-repeat is a different event kind and is
   * ignored, so holding ESC down skips one movie, not the next as well.
   *
   * Aborting ends the whole SEQUENCE, not the clip: the original records
   * state 2, and state 2 is what makes it clear the movie's next-segment
   * pointer (0x4493a9) instead of following it. So this drops the return
   * stack — a type-5 region has nothing to come back to once the sequence is
   * over — and finishes, resolving the blocked playmovie() exactly as a
   * natural end would. The frame's own action is NOT run: an abort is not the
   * exit region being clicked, which matters for the close-ups whose exit
   * chains to another movie.
   *
   * What the movie already did stands: the action-frame bits are recorded on
   * ENTERING a frame (recordAction), so a movie skipped after passing its
   * action frame still reports it to actionframe(), and one skipped before
   * still doesn't — the same as pressing ESC at that moment in the original.
   *
   * {@link escapeSkipsSegment} is the one way out, and no shipped film takes it.
