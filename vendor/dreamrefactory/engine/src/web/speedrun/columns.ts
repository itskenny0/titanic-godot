/**
 * What order the workbench's panels come in — the reader's answer, not ours.
 *
 * The page's row is four columns: the canvas, the Timer, the Speedrun sheet and
 * the X pane (speedrun/index.html, #srlayout). The canvas keeps the head of it,
 * because it is the thing being watched and nothing is read while it is off
 * screen. The other three are a genuine preference: the sheet is what a route is
 * written in, the Timer is what it reads out as, and the X pane is what you look
 * at when neither of those explains what the game just did — which of them wants
 * to be nearest the picture depends on what you are doing. That was being settled
 * by editing the markup, which is not a thing a reader of the page can do, so it
 * is settled by dragging one heading onto another instead, and it is remembered.
 *
 * Every one of the three is a `<section>`-shaped panel with an `<h2>`, and the
 * heading is the handle. The X pane is shared with /play, which has the same
 * heading and no handle at all: nothing there imports this, and with one panel
 * there would be nothing to reorder it against.
 *
 * ## Why the DOM moves rather than `order`
 *
 * A flex `order` would be one line and would not touch the tree. It would also
 * put the tab ring and the screen reader's reading order out of step with what
 * is on screen — the two are the same row, and the whole point of this is that
 * the reader chose the visual order, so that IS the order. Moving the node keeps
 * every listener (they travel with it), the textarea's value, and the painted
 * `<pre>` under it, because all of them are inside the section being moved.
 *
 * ## What is drawn while a drag is in flight
 *
 * The section it would land on, and only that. Dimming the one being CARRIED is
 * the usual other half, and it wants a `setTimeout(0)` — the browser takes the
 * drag image after the `dragstart` handler returns, so a class added there dims
 * the thing being carried as well as the thing left behind. That timer is a wall
 * clock, which the workbench declines to read wherever it can (the rule
 * taoot/tests/auto/reproducible.ts states for Titanic's tree, kept to here
 * because it is a good rule and not because this file is checked against it).
 * It is not worth an exemption for: the one you are carrying is the one you
 * grabbed, and the pointer is on it.
