/**
 * What a speedrun driver has to be able to do — and nothing about WHERE it runs.
 *
 * There are two implementations and they sit on opposite sides of a process
 * boundary:
 *
 *   - `taoot/tests/speedrun/driver.ts` drives a real browser from Node over Playwright.
 *     Every gesture is a genuine OS-level input event, which is what makes a run
 *     defensible as something a person could have done. It is the clock of
 *     record.
 *   - `page-driver.ts` beside it runs INSIDE the page, synthesizing DOM events
 *     against the canvas. No round trips at all, so the same sheet finishes
 *     faster — a different clock, and deliberately not comparable.
 *
 * The interface is the seam, and it is narrow on purpose. Two observations make
 * it possible at all:
 *
 * **Every question is already a string of JavaScript.** `wait(set == c73)` compiles
 * to an expression over `window.dbg` (actions.ts, `predicate`), and both hosts
 * can evaluate one — Playwright ships it over the wire, the page just runs it. So
 * the whole condition system ports with no work.
 *
 * **Every gesture is already a key or a point.** Nothing above this layer knows
 * how a press is delivered; it says "Escape" or "click 169,311" and the driver
 * decides whether that means a CDP command or a `dispatchEvent`.
 *
 * What does NOT port is the planner escape hatch (`travel`/`hunt`/`stand`): it
 * builds the Node-side browser driver, which parses `.SET` files off disk. Hence
 * {@link SpeedrunDriver.page} — present only on the Playwright side, and the one
 * thing an action may feature-detect on.
 */

/**
 * How much of the consequence of a gesture to wait for.
 *
 * The ladder is cheapest-first, and a sheet should use the cheapest one the next
 * action tolerates:
 *
 *   `none`   — dispatch and return. The engine queues what it cannot act on yet.
 *   `taken`  — until the event queue is empty, i.e. the press has been CONSUMED.
 *   `ready`  — until the engine would accept another gesture (the fade gate).
 *   `quiet`  — full quiescence, the browser suite's `settle`.

/**
 * The client coordinate that lands on canvas pixel `v` — and it is not
 * `origin + (v + 0.5) * scale` ([#277](https://github.com/dhobi/dreamrefactory/issues/277)).
 *
 * Both drivers aim in CANVAS pixels and the page reads them back with
 * `canvasCoords` (taoot/src/main.ts), which is
 * `Math.floor((client - origin) / size * n)`. Half a canvas pixel of centring
 * survives that round trip only while a canvas pixel is at least two client
 * pixels wide, because the coordinate that actually arrives is an INTEGER: the
 * browser delivers `clientX`/`clientY` whole, so half a pixel of aim plus a
 * fractional `rect.top` rounds DOWN into the pixel before the one asked for.
 *
 * Measured against the play page at nine widths, aiming at the coal lever's
 * twenty-one stops: at 1024px (a 2x scale) all 21 land, at 800px four miss, at
 * 700px eight, at 640px five, and at 512px — a 1:1 scale, where half a canvas
 * pixel is half a client pixel — twenty of the twenty-one miss. Every single
 * miss is low by exactly one.
 *
 * It reads as a dial bug because the coal lever is the one control with no
 * tolerance: `calcswitchdeg` clamps the cursor to 245..345 and divides by 5, so
 * one pixel is one whole setting and `dial(slider, 7)` lands on 6. Everything
 * else the driver clicks is a hotspot many pixels wide, which is why a one-pixel
 * error went unnoticed at every other gesture.
 *
 * So aim at an INTEGER inside the client interval that maps back to `v`:
 *
 *     origin + v * size / n  <=  client  <  origin + (v + 1) * size / n
 *
 * preferring the middle, so the aim is as far from both edges as the interval
 * allows. Below a 1:1 scale that interval can contain no integer at all — the
 * canvas pixel is then genuinely unaddressable, several of them sharing one
 * client pixel — and the nearest integer is returned rather than a fraction,
 * because a fraction is not what will arrive.

/**
 * How many `realYieldSeq` bumps a held drag waits for after each move, before
 * making the next one ([#293](https://github.com/dhobi/dreamrefactory/issues/293)).
 *
 * A dragged control is a script spinning in `while stilldown() { … forceupdate() }`,
 * and BOTH of those bump the counter — so one turn of that loop is two bumps and
 * this is a wait of exactly one turn. It used to be four, which is two turns, and
 * the dial steps once per turn: the driver was therefore turning every dial at
 * half the rate the game can be turned at, which is what the report measured
 * against its author's own hand (~12 s of script against 7–9 s by hand).
 *
 * Two is not a proof that the move has been consumed. Within a turn the bumps
 * are `stilldown` then `forceupdate` with the body between them, and depending
 * which of the two we sampled after, two bumps either straddle a body that ran
 * after our move or land just short of one. Four was the number that made it
 * certain.
 *
 * Certainty is not needed, because the gesture is CLOSED-LOOP: `turnOnce` reads
 * the deg every iteration and keeps swinging until it reads the one asked for,
 * so a move the loop did not see costs one more move and nothing else. The
 * direction cannot be lost with it — `limiter` reads only the sign of the
 * bearing change, and two of our moves accumulated into one read is the same
 * sign as one.
 *
 * Measured over the plant's six dials from one seed, so the scatter `openstage`
 * deals them is identical: 5.3 s of dialling at four bumps, 4.7 s at three, 3.7 s
 * at two and 3.5 s at one. One buys nothing over two and guarantees no turn at
 * all, so two it is — and the floor under both is the game's own loop, which is
 * the floor a hand has too. Landed on all six across four different seeds.
