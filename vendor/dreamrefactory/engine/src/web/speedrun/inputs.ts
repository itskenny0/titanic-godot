/**
 * What the run is pressing, drawn over the game.
 *
 * A speedrun sheet plays the game through synthesized events, so the one thing
 * you cannot see while watching a run is the run itself: the picture moves and
 * nothing says whether that was an arrow, a click, or the engine doing something
 * on its own. This is that missing half — a keyboard and a mouse in the corner
 * of the screen (which corner is speedrun/index.html's `#inputs`), each key
 * lighting as it is pressed.
 *
 * ## It watches, and it is not in the way
 *
 * Every listener is capture-phase and passive, exactly as the recorder's are: no
 * `preventDefault`, no `stopPropagation`, nothing returned. The overlay's own
 * element takes `pointer-events: none`, so the canvas underneath keeps every
 * gesture — a person can still play the game by hand through it.
 *
 * ## Synthetic events count, and that is the point
 *
 * `isTrusted` is deliberately NOT asked, which is the opposite of what the
 * recorder does with the same events. The recorder wants to know whether a HUMAN
 * made a gesture, because it is writing down what a human did; this wants to
 * know whether the GAME was told to do something, and a sheet's keypress is as
 * real to the engine as a finger's. So both light the same key.
 *
 * What it does ask is the question the engine asks: {@link focusOwnsKey}. Typing
 * a route into the sheet box is typing, not playing, and a keyboard that flashed
 * along with the editor would be reporting keys the game never saw.
 *
 * ## Which keys are drawn
 *
 * The ones a ROUTE presses, which is fewer than the ones the game takes:
 *
 *   - the ARROWS. Down as well as up: it is not a movement key in the original
 *     either, but `SMSTACK2`/`SMSTACK3`'s ladder platforms read it out of their
 *     scene `keydown` and it is the only way down a level (#100).
 *   - SPACE, the door opener.
 *   - ESC, which skips a spoken line and hammers through a cutscene.
 *   - the game's own MOVEMENT LETTERS, which light the arrow they are routed
 *     to rather than a key of their own. They are real bindings and not a
 *     convenience: BOOTFILE 0001's `keydown` is a router, and it maps
 *     `keynorth` -> uparrow, `keywest` -> leftarrow, `keyeast` -> rightarrow
 *     (session.ts) before the scene ever sees the press. W, A and D are only
 *     their DEFAULTS — the control panel rebinds them and a savegame carries
 *     the answer (`keynorth="w"`) — so the live values are read from the
 *     session and the display follows a rebind. S is the exception and is the
 *     display's own: there is no `keysouth`, the original binds three keys and
 *     not four, and S is here because a hand on WASD expects the set to be
 *     complete. It lights the DOWN arrow, which the smokestack ladders read.
 *   - one SPARE key, which is every other character. TI.EXE hands anything it
 *     does not name straight to the scripts as a literal, and the telegram is
 *     typed — `key(e)` — so the spare relabels itself to whatever was pressed
 *     rather than pretending the alphabet is not in play.
 *
 * M, O, X (the map, the hotspot overlay, the details pane), the 0-9 volume and
 * F1/F2's brightness are all keys the game takes and are all deliberately absent.
 * A route presses none of them — they change what the PLAYER sees, and a run has
 * nobody to see it — so drawing them cost a third of the display's width to show
 * a row that never lights. Anything pressed anyway still shows: it goes to the
 * spare, labelled, which is the other half of why the spare is there.
