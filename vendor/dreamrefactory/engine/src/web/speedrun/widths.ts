/**
 * How WIDE each workbench panel is — the reader's answer, like the order beside it.
 *
 * The row's three movable columns ship with a share each: the sheet asks for
 * 26rem, the Timer 22rem, the X pane 20rem, and whatever the window has left
 * over after the canvas is split between them (speedrun/index.html, #srlayout).
 * Those shares are a guess at what a reader wants, and they are wrong as often
 * as they are right — a long `wait(js: ...)` line wants the sheet wider, a
 * 161-row state list wants the pane wider, and the two people wanting those are
 * not doing the same job. So the edge between two columns is draggable, and
 * where it is dragged to is remembered.
 *
 * This is the second half of {@link ./speedrun-columns}: that one settles which
 * order the panels come in, this one settles how much of the row each takes —
 * the picture included, which is the one column that is not dragged (see
 * {@link installPictureScale} at the foot of this file).
 * They are separate files because they are separate answers, but they share the
 * list of what is movable and they have to agree about the tree — see the grip
 * placement below.
 *
 * ## Why a grip between the columns, and not `resize: horizontal`
 *
 * One CSS line against this whole file, and it does not work here. The sections
 * scroll (`overflow: auto` above the break), so the corner grip a UA draws sits
 * on top of the scrollbar and scrolls away with the content; the inline `width`
 * it writes is beaten by `flex-basis`; and nothing about it is remembered. The
 * same objection sinks a grip placed INSIDE a section: an absolutely positioned
 * one is clipped by the very `overflow` that makes the column readable.
 *
 * So the grip is a sibling in the row — a flex item of its own, sat in the gap
 * to the right of the section it belongs to. It cannot be clipped by a column
 * because it is not in one, it cannot collide with a scrollbar for the same
 * reason, and being a real box in the row means it stays put through a wrap
 * without anything recomputing where it goes.
 *
 * ## Two custom properties rather than an inline width
 *
 * `--col-w` and `--col-grow`, read by the stylesheet as
 * `flex: var(--col-grow, 1) 1 var(--col-w, 26rem)`. An inline `style.flex` would
 * be shorter and would be a bug: `#srlayout` is a COLUMN below the break, where
 * a flex-basis is a HEIGHT — a sheet dragged to 700px wide on a desktop would
 * come back as a 700px-tall panel on a phone. A custom property is inert until a rule
 * reads it, and only the rule inside the media query does, so a width means
 * nothing at a width where it means nothing.
 *
 * The grow half is what makes the drag track the pointer. A column left at
 * `flex-grow: 1` takes a share of the row's spare space on top of its basis, so
 * a 100px drag moves its edge by 67; pinned at grow 0 the basis IS the width,
 * and the edge lands where the pointer is.
 *
 * ## The limits are the stylesheet's, and are read back from it
 *
 * A column stops at 512px — the picture's own width at 1x, which the sheet and
 * the pane share, the Timer being allowed down to 200 — and at 1024 going the
 * other way. Both are already written down, in the `min-width` and `max-width`
 * beside the flex, so the drag asks
 * `getComputedStyle` what they are rather than repeating them here, where a
 * second copy would go stale the first time one of them moved. Same for the
 * break, which moves with the picture's scale and which nothing in this file
 * knows the number of: a grip below the break is `display: none` and cannot be
 * grabbed, so the question never comes up.
 *
 * ## Pointer-only, deliberately
 *
 * The same bargain {@link ./speedrun-columns} makes, for the same reason: this
 * is a workbench driven with a mouse. A column at its default width is a column
 * at a width someone chose, and everything on the page is reachable without ever
 * touching a grip.
