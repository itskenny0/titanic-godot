/**
 * The speedrun workbench — the panel under the game on `/speedrun/`.
 *
 * Write a sheet, press Play, watch it play, read which line broke. That loop is
 * the whole point: the Playwright runner takes a minute of process startup and a
 * terminal to read, and while a route is being written you want the answer in a
 * second, next to the thing it is about.
 *
 * ## The sheet is a program, and the pointer is where it is
 *
 * Three ideas hold this page together and each exists because the obvious
 * alternative was worse.
 *
 * **Sheets are the user's**, several of them, named and kept. A route gets tried
 * three ways and a leg gets pulled out to be worked on alone; with one box those
 * are the same box, and every attempt destroys the last.
 *
 * **The execution pointer** says where Play would start. It is a LINE, not an
 * index into a parse, so it survives the editing that goes on between runs.
 * Before it existed, jumping to a checkpoint meant rewriting the box with the
 * lines after it — a copy that immediately diverged from the sheet it came out
 * of, and that threw away everything above the cut.
 *
 * **Only three things move it**: Play (forward, one action at a time), a
 * checkpoint (to the line after its `save()`), and Stop or the end (back to the
 * top). Not the caret, not a click in the gutter. The point is that the game's
 * state and the pointer are one fact — a pointer you can drop anywhere is a way
 * to run a sheet from a place the game was never brought to, and the run that
 * follows is nonsense that takes an expert to recognise. A checkpoint is the
 * only jump because it is the only thing that moves both halves at once.
 *
 * It is deliberately a THIN layer. The parser, the action table and the run loop
 * are the same modules the CLI uses (`taoot/src/speedrun/`), so a sheet cannot mean one
 * thing here and another there — if it could, tuning here would be tuning against
 * the wrong game. All this file does is find the canvas, build the in-page driver,
 * and render what the runner reports.
 *
 * ## The one honest difference
 *
 * The events are synthetic. `main.ts` never asks `isTrusted`, so the engine
 * cannot tell — but they skip the browser's real input pipeline, which
 * Playwright's do not. The same sheet therefore finishes faster here. The page
 * says so under the controls, and this is not false modesty: two numbers that
 * measure different things should never be compared, and the moment someone
 * quotes a workbench time as a record the whole exercise stops meaning anything.
 *
 * ## Focus
 *
 * The textarea and the game share a document, and `main.ts` listens for keys on
 * `window`. That would be a problem — typing a sheet would walk the player around
 * — except the engine already guards for it: `focusOwnsKey(e.target, key)` bails
 * when the event came from a field. Typing in the textarea is typing; click away
 * and the arrows reach the game again. Nothing here has to do anything about it,
 * which is worth writing down so nobody later "fixes" it.

/**
 * The running clock: seconds since Play, counting — and NOT counting while the
 * page is downloading the game ([#251](https://github.com/dhobi/dreamrefactory/issues/251)).
 *
 * A route is a time, and until this existed the page did not show one until the
 * run was over — the splits table fills in a row at a time, so a leg with no
 * split in it showed nothing at all while it ran. This is the number a stopwatch
 * would be showing: it starts on Play, counts while the run does, and stops
 * where the run stopped so the last reading stays on screen to be read.
 *
 * ## The load remover
 *
 * It is a **load-removed** clock, which is a thing PC speedruns have had for
 * years and this port needs more than most: every room is a fetch, so the same
 * sheet against a cold cache and a warm one is minutes apart with not one
 * gesture changed, and a number that moved by minutes for reasons outside the
 * route is not a number anybody can tune against. So the wire's total
 * (engine/src/web/load-clock.ts) is subtracted from the wall clock, and while a fetch
 * is in the air the two grow together and the reading stands still. That is the
 * pause, and it needs nothing to arm it: the fetcher is the only thing that
 * knows a download has begun, so the fetcher is what says so
 * ({@link FileStore.onBusy}).
 *
 * It SAYS it has stopped, rather than just stopping — `#srclock.waiting` while
 * the wire is busy. A stopwatch that freezes with no explanation reads as a
 * hung page, which is exactly the complaint the busy mark on the canvas exists
 * to answer (taoot/src/main.ts).
 *
 * A Pause is the other way round and deliberately so: pausing a run does not
 * stop this clock, because a pause is time the run took. Loading is time the
 * network took.
 *
 * Still the same clock the splits are measured on, which is the property that
 * matters — the runner removes the loading from every leg by the same
 * subtraction (taoot/src/speedrun/runner.ts), so the ticking number and the
 * `elapsed` column agree at the moment a split closes rather than drifting
 * apart by whatever was downloaded.
 *
 * Ticking is a `setInterval` in the page, which is what {@link CLOCK_ALLOWED} in
 * taoot/tests/auto/reproducible.ts already covers this file for: nothing the engine
 * reads hangs off it.
