/**
 * The speedrun sheet — the run as a list of actions, in text.
 *
 * A sheet is data, not code. That is the whole point of it: a speedrun is tuned
 * by moving one line, changing one bevel, shaving one wait, and running it again
 * — and none of that should mean editing TypeScript, recompiling, or reasoning
 * about whether a helper is shared with the route the playthrough suite asserts.
 * `taoot/tests/playthrough` is the ORACLE and does not move; this is the stopwatch.
 *
 * ## The grammar
 *
 * Every action is a CALL. One per line, `#` to the end of the line is a comment:
 *
 *     up()                              # a bare action
 *     right(); up(); space()            # three actions on one line
 *     clickAt(169, 311)                 # positional arguments, comma separated
 *     closeUp(memory, by: esc)          # ...and named ones after them
 *     talk(purser[1,3,5])               # bevel ids, in the order they're offered
 *     wait(set == c73, budget: 90000)   # a condition, then a named argument
 *     left(x3)                          # the same action three times
 *     split(flat scored)                # the whole inside is the name
 *     move(u,r,u,o)                     # a path: four actions on one line
 *
 * Four token shapes inside the brackets, separated by commas:
 *
 *   - a bare word is a positional argument (`click(cards)`)
 *   - `name: value` is a named argument (`by: esc`, `until: quiet`, `wait: none`)
 *   - `name == value` / `name.thing` is a CONDITION — never an argument
 *   - `xN` is a repeat count (`left(x3)`)
 *   - `word[1,3,5]` carries a bevel list, and its commas are its own — so
 *     `talk(purser[1,3,5])` is one conversation with three answers
 *
 * A value that needs a comma or a bracket of its own is quoted:
 * `wait(js == "a, b")`.
 *
 * Calls and not bare words because the two things a sheet does most are pass
 * arguments and pass none, and the older grammar made those look alike: `click
 * memory, obit` was three clicks while `clickAt 169 311` was one action with two
 * arguments, and only knowing the verb told you which. Brackets settle it — a
 * comma is always an argument separator now, and an action that wants doing three
 * times says `x3` rather than being written three times in a row.
 *
 * ## What the parser refuses
 *
 * Everything it can, as early as it can, naming the line. A speedrun sheet is
 * edited far more often than it is read, and the failure mode being designed
 * against is a typo that costs a twenty-minute run rather than a parse. So an
 * unknown verb, an unknown option, a bevel list on a verb that has no use for
 * one and a repeat count on a `split` are all parse errors with a line number
 * and the offending text — not something discovered at minute nineteen.
 *
 * The verb table itself lives in actions.ts, next to the code that executes it,
 * and is passed in. One list, so a verb cannot be executable and unparseable or
 * the other way round.
