/**
 * Where to click to hit a named thing.
 *
 * ONE definition, used by both drivers. The headless one calls these functions
 * directly; the browser one ships their SOURCE into the page ({@link aimSource})
 * and calls them there, because the loop below is tens of thousands of hit tests
 * and cannot be run one round trip at a time. Nothing here may reference anything
 * outside this module, and what it references inside it, `aimSource` must carry
 * along — the first version shipped `aimAtThing` alone and the page threw on the
 * sibling it calls.
 *
 * That matters more than it sounds. These functions decide not just where a
 * click lands but WHETHER a thing is reachable from where you are standing —
 * `hunt` walks on to the next standpoint when the answer is null. Two drivers
 * sweeping on different grids therefore explore a room differently and end up
 * facing different ways, which is precisely the kind of difference that looks
 * like a browser bug and isn't. (It was: a finer sweep found the watch one
 * standpoint earlier than a coarser one.)
 *
 * The rule the sweep exists to keep: only ever aim at a point the engine's own
 * hit test resolves to the thing. An actor stands in front of a view's hotspots
 * in the click order, so the middle of a doorway can belong to whoever is
 * loitering in it — and a click there is a conversation, not a door.
 *
 * ## How big the screen is, is the GAME's fact
 *
 * The full-screen sweep used to run `y < 384, x < 512`, which is Titanic's
 * screen written into the layer that aims at any DreamFactory game. Two of the
 * three ports on this site are that size — Dust presents 512x384 through a
 * 1024x768 canvas — and the third is not: Timelapse is 640x480 and says so
 * (`ScreenPresenter`), so a sweep with Titanic's numbers in it would have
 * searched five eighths of its screen and called the rest unreachable.
 *
 * So the bounds come off the adapter ({@link Aim.width}, {@link Aim.height}),
 * which every caller answers from `host.screen` — the presenter that owns the
 * framebuffer the hit test is asked about. That is the one authority: a CANVAS
 * may be any multiple of it (Dust's is 2x), and a point is aimed in framebuffer
 * pixels because that is what `hitTestAt` takes.
