/**
 * The speedrun driver that runs INSIDE the page.
 *
 * Same {@link SpeedrunDriver} contract as the Playwright one, same sheets, same
 * actions — but no process boundary, so every `evaluate` is a function call
 * instead of a round trip and every wait polls on the animation frame the engine
 * is already drawing on.
 *
 * ## What it is and is not
 *
 * It is a **previewer**: paste a sheet, watch it play, fix the line that broke,
 * run it again — without leaving the browser. That loop is the point.
 *
 * It is **not the clock of record**, and the difference is not a detail. The
 * events it makes are synthetic (`isTrusted: false`), which the engine cannot
 * tell apart — `main.ts` never asks — but which do skip the browser's real input
 * pipeline. Playwright's presses do not. So a time measured here is a time for a
 * machine that had no input latency at all, and it will beat the Playwright run
 * on the same sheet. Two clocks, and the page says so on its face.
 *
 * ## Synthesizing what main.ts listens for
 *
 * Read off the listeners rather than guessed:
 *
 *   - **keys** — `window.addEventListener("keydown")`, reading `e.key`. Dispatched
 *     at `window`, so `e.target` is the window and `focusOwnsKey` correctly says
 *     the page is not typing into a field. (That check is why the textarea can
 *     stay on screen while the run plays: type in it and the game does not see
 *     the letters; click away and it does.)
 *   - **clicks** — `screen.addEventListener("pointerdown")` on the canvas, plus
 *     `pointerup`/`pointermove` on the window, all mapped through
 *     `canvasCoords`: `((clientX - rect.left) / rect.width) * canvas.width`. So a
 *     canvas pixel is turned back into a client point through the same rectangle,
 *     and the engine recovers exactly the pixel asked for.
 *   - `pointerType: "mouse"` explicitly, because the handler branches on it —
 *     a "touch" press is ambiguous until it moves and goes down a different path
 *     (`beginTouch`).

 * Where a load point lives in this host.
 *
 * Exported because the workbench asks the same question from outside a run —
 * it greys out the button for a leg whose starting save has not been made yet —
 * and two spellings of one key is exactly the bug that would make that answer
 * quietly wrong.
 *
 * ## A checkpoint belongs to a SHEET
 *
 * The key carries the sheet's name as well as the point's, and that is not
 * bookkeeping. `save(m1p0)` means "the game as it stands at this line of THIS
 * route", and two sheets are two routes: an `m1p0` written by a run that took
 * the long way round the boat deck is a different game state from one written by
 * a run that did not, and under a name-only key the second silently overwrote
 * the first. What made it worse than a lost save is what the chips then did —
 * jumping to a point belonging to another sheet restores its game and then finds
 * no `save()` line to move the pointer to, so the game stands somewhere the
 * route does not name, which is the one state the workbench is built to prevent.
 *
 * Both halves are percent-encoded, so the ":" between them cannot occur inside
 * either and the key can always be taken apart again ({@link SaveKeys.parse}).
 *
 * The Node runner has no sheets — a sheet is a FILE there — and keys its saves
 * by name alone under `out/speedrun/`. Nothing is shared between the two stores,
 * which was already true.
 *
 * ## ...and a sheet belongs to a GAME
 *
 * Hence the factory rather than three constants: `localStorage` is per ORIGIN,
 * and the deployed site serves every game off one. Titanic's workbench and
 * Dust's would share a key space, so a `m1p0` written against one disc could be
 * restored into the other — a save the engine would take (both games write the
 * same container) and that names rooms the running game does not have.
 *
 * The game's own word for itself is the namespace, and Titanic's is `taoot`, so
 * its keys are the ones already in a player's browser, byte for byte.

   * carry a held item and read `mouse()` every turn, `trackbut` lights a stage

   * carried object LANDS from what `hittest` finds when the button comes up.
   *
   * Dispatching down and up in one task gives the engine no gap at all. The press

   * the script chain runs its first line the button is already up and every one of

   * in the coal bunker, where the drop is the release and the release never
   * happened while anything was listening.
   *

     * JavaScript context, so an action that awaited it and carried on would be
     * running against a dying page — a torn-off canvas, a `window.dbg` that is
     * about to stop existing — and would report whatever nonsense it read there
     * as the state of the game. Hanging is the honest shape: the run ends here,
     * and it is the page that comes back, not this call.
