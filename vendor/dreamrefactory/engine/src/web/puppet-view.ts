/**
 * Rendering for puppet mode — the conversation close-ups (openpuppetfile).
 *
 * A puppet replaces the world display with a talking character composited
 * from up to 11 sprite layers (lip sync, blinks, gestures — see
 * {@link PUP_LAYERS}), a subtitle strip, and the choice "bevels": the rows of
 * clickable answer text along the bottom of the screen. The conversation
 * LOGIC (which line plays, which choices show) lives in
 * runtime/puppet.ts; this file only draws the current state and hit-tests
 * the bevels.
 *
 * The geometry below is not a design: every number is read out of TI.EXE, and
 * the routine that yielded it is named at each constant. The plaques the
 * answers sit on are not drawn at all — they are a picture the PUP carries
 * ({@link PupFile.bandLocation}), blitted over the room's interface band
 * before each redraw (0x440e30 -> 0x411e80), with bare `DrawString`s on top.
