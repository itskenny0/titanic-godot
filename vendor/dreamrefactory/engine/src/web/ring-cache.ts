 *
 * Frames are DELTA-encoded — each is a patch on the buffer the previous one
 * left — so they cannot be decoded individually. The chain unit is the ring,
 * and a ring turns out to be entirely self-contained: its first frame
 * repaints every pixel. Measured over the 20 largest TAOOT sets — all 998 rings,
 * each decoded from a fresh buffer and from a deliberately poisoned one —
 * every frame comes out byte-identical. So a ring needs no base, and the
 * order rings are decoded in doesn't matter.
 *
 * That was not always the reading. Before the codec's back-references were
 * fixed to tile (see decodeFrame's run mode 7), 38 of those rings "needed"
 * a predecessor and roads "needed" the standpoint they depart — both were
 * the same corruption seen from different angles.
 *
 * The alternative (what this replaces) was decoding every ring at set-open:
 * 366 MB for the boat deck. Frames already on screen or queued in an
 * animation are held by reference, so eviction can never blank them.
