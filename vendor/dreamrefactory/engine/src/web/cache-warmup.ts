/**
 * Pull the whole edition through the browser's cache before a run starts.
 *
 * The workbench's problem is not that files are slow to fetch — it is that they
 * are slow to fetch ONCE, and a route is run fifty times. `FileStore` releases a
 * set when you leave the room and caps what it keeps of the 328 MB of movies
 * (taoot/src/files.ts), which is right for playing and merciless for timing: the same
 * leg costs a download on the first run and a memory read on the second, so two
 * runs of one sheet are not two readings of one thing. Worse, the first run
 * through a new leg is the one somebody is watching to find out whether the leg
 * WORKS, and a 34 MB set arriving mid-walk looks exactly like a hang.
 *
 * The browser already solves this and is never asked to: a file fetched once is
 * served from the memory or disk cache the next time, whoever asks. So the fix
 * is not a cache of our own — it is to ask for everything, early, and throw the
 * bytes away. What is left behind is the HTTP cache, warm, and every later fetch
 * the game makes hits it (#147).
 *
 * ## Thrown away, not held
 *
 * The English tree is 664 files and 1.2 GB. Nothing here keeps a byte of it: each
 * response is drained through its reader a chunk at a time and dropped, which is
 * what puts it in the disk cache without putting it in this tab's heap. That is
 * also where the progress comes from — bytes actually read off the wire, so the
 * bar tells the truth on a re-warm (everything hits, the rate reads in the
 * hundreds of MB/s, and the run is over in seconds) rather than pretending to
 * download what it already has.
 *
 * ## What the browser will actually keep — measured
 *
 * The whole thing rests on the HTTP cache accepting a gigabyte, so it was worth
 * checking rather than assuming, and both answers came out well:
 *
 *  - **The tree fits.** 664 files and 1.13 GB warmed into a fresh Chromium
 *    profile on a disk with 199 GB free; re-fetched afterwards, all of it came
 *    back from the disk cache — the 37.5 MB `leave.mov` fetched FIRST included,
 *    so nothing was evicted by what followed it.
 *  - **The deployment is cacheable without touching it.** The static host sends
 *    no `Cache-Control` at all, but it does send `Last-Modified: 1996` — so the
 *    heuristic rule (a tenth of the file's age) makes every one of them fresh
 *    for years. Nothing had to be configured for this to work.
 *
 * The one profile where it does NOT hold is a small one. Chromium refuses to
 * store any single entry larger than an eighth of its cache, and in an ephemeral
 * profile with a ~56 MB cache that threshold measured between 6.0 and 8.1 MB —
 * so a private window keeps the small files and re-downloads every set and movie
 * worth caching. That is a property of the browser and not something this can
 * fix; it is written down so the next person measuring a disappointing warmup
 * knows where to look first.
 *
 * It is also why the DEV server is not part of this. Vite's `/gamefiles`
 * middleware sends no validators at all, so nothing it serves is storable —
 * `Cache-Control: no-cache` plus `Last-Modified` was tried and Chromium still
 * did not keep a byte, and the `max-age` that does work would serve a stale
 * `.SET` after an export from the editors. Locally the files come off the disk
 * anyway. The button is for the deployed site.
 *
 * ## What this file is NOT
 *
 * It is not the "load in anticipation" idea in #147 — the graph analysis that
 * would fetch a room's neighbours while you stand in it. That is a real feature
 * for a real player on a real connection, and it needs to know what is one click
 * away. This knows nothing and thinks about nothing: it is a bucket of URLs and
 * a pool of six fetches, for the one case where fetching EVERYTHING is not
 * absurd, because the person at the keyboard is about to use all of it.
