 * Palette entries are {int16 index, int16 rgb[3]} where the usable 8-bit
 * channel value is the high byte of each int16 (DFfile.h ColorPalette use).
 * Returns a 256*4 RGBA table.
 *
 * "The high byte" is one of this function's two endianness questions: it sits at
 * +1 of each component on a PC rip and at +0 on a Macintosh one, which is 16
 * bits of precision nobody ever had a use for landing on the other side of the
 * pair. Read the wrong way a palette does not look subtly off — it comes out as
 * 256 near-black entries, because the low byte of a component whose high byte is
 * anything at all is noise.
 *
 * ## The other question: the two RESERVED entries, and whose they are
 *
 * On a PC rip index 0 is forced black and index 255 white — mirroring dfet's BMP
 * writer, and right for Titanic and Dust. It is worth knowing WHY it is right,
 * because the answer is a fact about Windows rather than about DreamFactory: a
 * palettised Windows display reserves the two ends of the system palette, black
 * at 0 and white at 255, and no application gets to use them. So the port has to
 * put them back whatever the file stores — and what the file stores is the other
 * way round. Every DF palette in every rip, PC and Mac alike, carries WHITE at
 * entry 0 and BLACK at entry 255, because DreamFactory was authored on a Mac and
 * that is the Macintosh system palette's reserved pair.
 *
 * Which means the Mac pressing of Skull Cracker needed no remap at all: its
 * reserved entries were the ones already in the file, and overriding them would
 * have been the PC's correction applied to a picture that never needed
 * correcting. The Windows pressing that replaced it is a PC release like the
 * rest, and does want the correction.
 *
 * The switch below is on the byte ORDER, which is a proxy for "whose build is
 * this" and not the thing itself — worth saying, because `byte-order.ts` is at
 * pains to point out that the order is a fact about the title rather than the
 * platform. It was sound for every disc this port has read: the little-endian
 * ones are the PC releases it renders, and the Macintosh Skull Cracker pressing
 * was not. Now that pressing is gone, every disc in the corpus takes the same
 * side of the switch — which makes the proxy right by default and exercised by
 * nothing, so treat it as untested rather than as confirmed. What it could not
 * distinguish either way is a MACINTOSH release shipping converted data —
 * Titanic's Dutch disc ships exactly such a build — where the data would want the
 * PC correction and the display would not. Nothing here renders one, and the day
 * something does, this wants a flag of its own rather than a cleverer proxy.
 *
 * ## Both Skull Cracker releases were read, and they prove the model
 *
 * The reasoning above was worked out from the Macintosh disc alone, one frame of
 * it load-bearing. The Windows release — the one that stayed, and the only Skull
 * Cracker disc this port reads now — settles it from outside, and the way it does
 * is better than agreement: **the conversion swapped the two indices in the PIXEL
 * DATA.** Over every film on each disc —
 *
 *   | disc    | index 0 | index 255 |
 *   |---------|---------|-----------|
 *   | Mac     |  0.14%  |  27.34%   |
 *   | Windows | 27.52%  |   0.14%   |
 *
 * — a mirror, because the authoring pipeline remapped 0 and 255 to land on
 * whichever end the target platform reserves. `Belfry.mov`'s flat frame is 100%
 * index 0 on the Mac disc and 100% index 255 on the Windows one, and under the
 * rules below both render WHITE: the lightning flash that a single frame's worth
 * of inference had called, confirmed by a disc that was not consulted to make the
 * call. The menu's first frame decodes pixel-for-pixel identically from the two
 * files — 0 differences over 196608 pixels, from files of 1.74 MB and 1.08 MB
 * whose every integer runs the other way.
 *
 * Measured on the MAC pressing's 66 films — 18,725 frames, 1.83 billion pixels.
 * Read the two indices exchanged for the Windows disc, per the table above: what
 * is said of 255 here is true of 0 there, and the palette correction on that side
 * lands each of them on the same colour anyway, which is the point of the table.
 *
 *   - index 255 is **27.34%** of every pixel in the game and appears in 15,879
 *     of those frames. It is the ground the whole game is drawn on: forcing it
 *     to white turns a black chapter card into a white one and puts a white
 *     halo around every object in the menu.
 *   - index 0 is **0.14%**, and one frame in the entire rip is substantially
 *     made of it — `Belfry.mov` frame 100, which is 100% index 0 and sits
 *     between two frames of night sky. A single full-screen frame in the middle
 *     of a storm is a lightning flash, so that entry is white, which is what the
 *     file says it is.
 *
 * ## The reserve does not depend on `colorCount`
 *
 * Both ends are forced whatever `colorCount` says, because the reserve belongs to
 * the DISPLAY and `colorCount` describes a CONTRIBUTOR. A set contributes entries
 * 0..127 and the stage owns the rest ({@link file://./set.ts}'s `colorCount`), so
 * the room view asks for 128 — and used to get an upper half of nothing, which is
 * opaque black once {@link indexedToRGBA} stamps the alpha on.
 *
 * That was #351. Two sets in the corpus draw a view pixel above 127 — c73 and
 * lnghall, the same two `SetViewer.bandPropPalette` names — and the only index
 * either of them strays onto is 255. In c73 that is 6811 pixels: the ceiling
 * light and the pool under the table lamp in the mission-4 cabin, which came out
 * as black blobs in the middle of the highlight. The pixels touching one average
 * rgb(210,208,179), so they are the brightest part of a bright thing, and 255 on
 * a Windows display is white.
 *
 * The file itself says rgb(0,0,0) there — c73's stored entry 255 and main.stg's
 * are the Mac reserved black, byte for byte identical across all 128 upper
 * entries — which is exactly why this correction exists, and why it cannot be
 * conditional on who filled the lower half.

 * Colorize an indexed frame into an RGBA pixel buffer (e.g. for ImageData).
 *
 * This is the single hottest function in the client — every frame expands the
 * stage flat, the set view, or the movie image through it, which at 512×384 is
 * ~200k pixels, 60 times a second. So it writes one 32-bit word per pixel
 * rather than four clamped bytes (~2.7x, measured), which costs a 256-entry
 * palette table per call — a rounding error against the pixels.
 *
 * `out`, when given, must start at the beginning of its buffer: it is viewed as
 * u32, so a byte-misaligned subarray would throw. Every caller passes an
 * ImageData's `data` or a whole freshly allocated array, both of which do.
