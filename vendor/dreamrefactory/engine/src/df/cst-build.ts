/**
 * Building a CST cast from nothing — the write side of [`cst.ts`](cst.ts)'s
 * reader. See [`build.ts`](build.ts) for why these modules exist.
 *
 * A cast is the walking half of a character: members (`morrow`, `sasha`), each
 * with poses, each pose a grid of **steps × 8 views** of transparent-codec
 * sprites. The 8 views are the compass the runtime picks from when a
 * character faces the camera one way or another, and a step is one frame of the
 * walk cycle.
 *
 * A direction slot may be **empty** — the shipped casts have holes, and the
 * runtime falls back to a neighbouring direction rather than failing — so a pose
 * takes `(ShpFrame | null)[]` per step and means it.
