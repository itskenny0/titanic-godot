/**
 * STG files — "stages": full-screen 2D UI layers (flats) with their own
 * scripts. MAIN.STG is the standard in-game frame (the wood-panelled band
 * below the 512×264 view); INVEN1/2.STG are the inventory screens; the
 * mini-games (BLKJACK, FIGHT, …) are multi-flat stages.
 *
 * Container 0 header: palette @56 (256×8), flat count @2120, then 46-byte
 * flat records @2124. Container 1 is the stage's main script. Flat images
 * use the common frame codec.
 *
 * ## Both engines, one reader
 *
 * Dust (DreamFactory 1) calls these `.FLT` and its boot says
 * `openstagefile("new.flt")` — the same builtin, a renamed extension — and the
 * MODEL is the same one: flats, each with a script, a picture and a table of
 * clickable regions. So this reads both, which is the opposite of the call made
 * for SET (see {@link file://./set-v1.ts}, where v1 movement is a different idea
 * and got its own file).
 *
 * What differs is where the fields sit, and v4 is the one that grew:
 *
 *                       v1 (.FLT)      v4 (.STG)
 *   palette                  0x24           0x38
 *   stage name                  -           2104
 *   flat count               2100           2120
 *   flat record              28 B           46 B
 *   region count      +0 of the      +1028 of the click-logic container
 *
 * A v1 flat record carries only the three container refs and its name; the
 * `condition`, `width` and `height` that v4 added are not there, so a v1 flat is
 * reported at the stage's own screen size, which is what it is — 512x384, from
 * the header, for every flat on the disc.

   * A 16-byte Pascal string abutting the flat count, and it went unnoticed for as

   * its stages say `"main.stg"`, `"map.stg"`, `"bomb.stg"` and so on, so answering
   * `currentstage()` with the file was indistinguishable from answering with this.
   *
   * A v1 `.FLT` has one too, 20 bytes earlier at c0+2084 — this was read as "v1
   * has no such field" until DF.EXE's own stage parser was read (`add ebx, 0x824`
   * then the Pascal-string copy at `0x401146`). All 20 of Dust's carry a real one,
   * and six of them do NOT match their filename: `CREDITS.FLT` says `"cred.flt"`,
   * `INVEN/HIST.FLT` `"DBhist.flt"`, `INVEN/PAGES.FLT` `"TORN.flt"`,
   * `SALGAMES.FLT` `"cardflats"`, `UNDER/SNAKE.FLT` `"puzzle"`, `NEW.FLT` `"new"`
   * — so on Dust the distinction is visible in the data, the way Timelapse's
   * `"interface"` made it visible on v4 (#325).
   *
   * Timelapse is where the two part company. Its 155 world stages all say
   * `"stagename"` — the authoring tool's unfilled default, left as shipped — and
   * `p.stg` alone says **`"interface"`**, which is the name its BOOTFILE tests:
   *
   *     if arg = " "
   *         if currentstage () = "interface"
   *             endinterface ()
   *         else
   *             begininterface (1)
   *
   * So SPACE opened the panel and could never close it again: `currentstage()`
   * answered `"p.stg"`, the test failed, and the branch that puts the panel away
   * was unreachable. The two Titanic stages that DON'T match their filename are
   * `inven1.stg` and `inven2.stg`, both `"inven.stg"`, and nothing compares
   * `currentstage()` against either — the inventory's own `switch currentstage()`
   * runs after `transfromflat()` has already popped back to the stage underneath.
   *
   * The FILE is still reachable: `currentstage()` leaves it in `result()`, which
   * is how the game's own `begininterface` reads both —
   * `laststage = currentstage ()` and then `laststage = result ()`.
