 * the engine heartbeat, which sat at 66 ms for as long as the engine's was 50 —
 * a constant with a second copy is a constant that will drift.
 *

 * With a soundtrack, audio may be a short one-shot SFX, not a pacing track —
 * bombopen.mov's latch click (~0.4 s) over 22 frames would otherwise play the

 * audio can only make frames SLOWER (faucet stays 145 ms), never faster than
 * the floor. The soundtrack still plays once from frame 0.
 *
 * Region-less, soundtrack-less cutscenes still self-advance via their frame
 * type-6/7 STEP actions (the intro logos, the date captions — logo.mov,
 * datebed.mov, and 3 others; the ONLY region-less/no-audio movies in the
 * corpus, all of which step). They must pace on the clock, or the boot
 * sequence hangs on frame 0. They carry no authored timing (the MOV format
 * has no per-frame duration), so spread the movie over a fixed ~3 s total —
 * a held publisher logo (logo.mov, 3 frames) reads as a logo rather than a
 * flash, while a longer animation (cratep.mov, 25 frames) still plays at a
 * sane rate. Clamped to [native, 1200 ms] per frame. A region-less movie
 * with no step frames stays pure click-through (interval 0) — a close-up.
 *
 * Interactive movies auto-advance their step frames between the clickable
 * states. 145 ms is the FAUCET rate — but that's specifically to sync the
 * water animation to its babbling audio; it's too slow (~7 fps) for a SILENT
 * animation that merely carries a skip/exit region (bedmem/bedmant, the
 * wash + fire loops). With no audio there's nothing to pace against, so
 * animate at the stable native rate; keep 145 ms only when the movie has
 * audio whose frame-entry sounds were timed to it.
