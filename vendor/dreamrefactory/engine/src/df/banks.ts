 * pressing of Skull Cracker — read here before the Windows release replaced it —
 * it was the WRONG half: the count of a one-record table read 0, so the film's
 * bed was silently empty and the menu played without its music.
 *
 * Read as i32 in the file's own order, both orders get the same field. That the
 * skipped bytes really were the high half rather than something else is measured
 * rather than assumed: reading both ways through the production entry points
 * ({@link readAudioBank} and `readMovFile`) over every bank and film in the three
 * little-endian rips then in the corpus — 1973 films and 646 banks — the two
 * readings differ nowhere.
 * So no PC file changes its reading, and the suite that plays those games through
 * is unmoved.
 *
 * (The comparison has to go through those entry points and not over raw
 * containers: Dust's v1 `.SND` banks have no loop table at all, and forcing this
 * reader onto container 1 of one produces thousands of differences between two
 * meaningless numbers. `readAudioBank` routes a v1 bank to {@link file://./snd.ts}
