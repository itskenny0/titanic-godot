 *    animation-logic container (lip sync), addressed by ident
 *    ("smeth1.031") from puppetspeak()
 *  - scripts ("Boot Script" + branch scripts) that drive the conversation
 *    with puppetspeak/puppetbevel/puppetevent
 *  - stances: layered talking-head art (Background, Body, Head, Eyes,
 *    Eyebrows, Nose, Jaw, arms/hands), frames in the SHP transparent
 *    codec, anchored like props at the view centre (256,132)
 *
 * Layout (dfet DFpup + probing SMETH1.PUP):
 *   container 0: palette @58, dialogue count i16 @2158,
 *                312-byte records @2160 {i16 stance, i16, i16 tick count @+6,

 *                pascal text @+24 (256B), pascal ident @+280 (32B)}
 *   container 2: script table count i16 @22, 40-byte records @24
 *                {i32 location, i32, pascal name[31]}
 *   container 3: stance register, 64 × i32 @22 -> stance containers;
 *                stance container: 11 layer tables @22, 262 bytes each
 *                {i16 count, i16 anchorY, i16 anchorX, i32 locations[32],
 *                 i32 handles[32]} — the second half is runtime scratch the

 * header with literals in it, and #325 listed the literals as suspect on exactly

 * IMMEDIATES, one call each, into four globals:
 *
 *     TI.EXE 0x43ef30            DF.EXE 0x435910
 *       push 0; ... 0x489ff0       push 0; ... 0x460be6

 *       push 3; ... 0x489ff4       push 3; ... 0x460bea
 *
 * and each global is then used for one thing: container 2 is the script table
 * (`cmp word [eax+0x16]` for the count, records from `+0x18` — this reader's 22
 * and 24), and container 3 is the stance side. DF.EXE walks its container 3 with
 * the 262-byte layer stride directly (`shl ecx,6; add ecx,eax; lea ebx,[eax+ecx*2]`
 * at `0x4359f7`), which is the second reading of "a v1 puppet has exactly one
 * stance and container 3 IS it" — the first was the corpus.
 *
 * So this is a `byte-order.ts`-shaped answer: no field exists because the
 * format has no field, and the literals are the engine's own. Named here so the
