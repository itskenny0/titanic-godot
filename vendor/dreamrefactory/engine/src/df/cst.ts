/**
 * CST ("cast") files — the characters. GANG.CST holds the 25 named story
 * characters, EXTRA.CST the background passengers. Each cast member has a
 * script (setupactor/idle/mousedown live there) and a list of image SETS
 * (poses): "stand"/"standlj"/"walk"..., each holding sprite frames in the
 * SHP transparent codec, and one picture per stored view of each animation
 * step (usually eight around the compass, but see {@link CastFrame.angle}).
 *
 * Layout (validated against GANG.CST):
 *   container 0: palette @36 (256*8), puppet count i32 @0x938,
 *                16-byte records @0x93C -> logic container
 *   logic container: script loc i32 @0x26, name pascal @0x2A,
 *                    set count i32 @0x5A, 32-byte set records @0x5E
 *                    (i32 set container + pascal name @+16)
 *   set container: play script @0x2E with its length @0x70, frame count i32
 *                  @0x72, 44-byte records @0x76:
 *                  i32 frame container, i16 animation step @+8, i16 ordinal
 *                  within the step @+10, padded size Y-first @+22, offset
 *                  Y-first @+26, depicted angle i16 (0..255 space) @+40,
 *                  reference scale i16 @+42
 *
 * A member's logic container is the SAME record shape as a SHP prop group's
 * (script @38, pascal name[47] @42, sub-count @90, 32-byte sub-records @94 with
 * a pascal name[15] @+16), and a pose's set container the same shape as a SHP
 * state's (count @114, 44-byte frame records @118, degree @+40, refScale @+42).
 * That is not a coincidence to lean on for decoding — both are read here
 * independently — but it does say what the name FIELD SIZES are, which is what
 * the edit path needs: a shop writes those fields whole, and so can a cast.
