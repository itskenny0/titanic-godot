 * it. TRUNK.SHP's gramdrawer breaks that. Its three wax variants share one
 * order-table convention (open* = 1..N, close* = N..1), but the `1`/`2` art is
 * stored in the OPPOSITE direction from the `12` art, so the table plays those
 * four states backwards: clicking the drawer open showed it already open, slid
 * it shut, then snapped it open again (and the mirror of that on close).
 *
 * So when a state's settled pose sits at the wrong END of the played sequence,
 * flip the sequence. This is a structural check, not a list of known-bad state
 * names, and it only fires on a state that HAS a matching `idle<S>` pose landing
 * on the wrong end — across the shipped corpus (226 prop groups) that is exactly
 * gramdrawer's open1/open2/close1/close2. Every other open/close pair (the
 * boiler door, the four bags, the fusebox switches) already satisfies the
 * invariant and is left untouched.
 *
 * It flips the PLAY SCRIPT where there is one, and the frames themselves only for
 * a state that has none (a deg-split animation, whose sequence is its stored
 * order). Judging the ends by the script matters as much as fixing them by it:
 * the ends of `frames` are not the ends of the animation once a table says
