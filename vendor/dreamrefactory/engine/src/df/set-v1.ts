/**
 * SET files as *Dust: A Tale of the Wired West* (DreamFactory 1, 1995) writes
 * them — a separate reader from {@link file://./set.ts}, and separate on purpose.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a branch inside the v4 reader
 *
 * The header offsets moving would be a branch. What actually differs is the
 * MODEL of movement, and a shared reader would have to pretend the two are one
 * thing.
 *
 * A v4 set is scenes (standpoints), each carrying a full 360° ring of turn
 * frames, joined by roads whose two frame registers walk you between them. A v1
 * set has neither ring nor road. It has a GRID of cells, and one flat table of
 * TRANSITIONS in which a turn and a walk are the same kind of record:
 *
 *     from (x, z, facing)  ->  to (x, z, facing)   + a run of frames
 *
 * Turning is the record where the cell is equal and the facing differs; walking
 * is the record where the facing is equal and the cell differs. APOTH.SET has 28
 * of them, and 28 is exactly 3 walkable cells × 8 turns (four facings, each way
 * round) + 4 walks (0↔1, 1↔2). Nothing else is stored, because nothing else
 * exists: there is no way to face a direction the table has no record for.
 *
 * So Titanic's rings and roads are the EVOLUTION of this table — the same idea
 * with the turns factored out of it. Reading v1 through the v4 shapes would mean
 * synthesizing rings that were never authored; reading it as what it is costs one
 * file and stays honest.
 *
 * ## The frame runs, and the sixth container
 *
 * A transition record names its FIRST frame container and not how many follow.
 * Each is allotted {@link FRAME_SLOT} containers, of which the MOVE is the first
 * {@link RUN_FRAMES} — five — ending on the arrival standpoint's picture. A move
 * that wants fewer leaves the tail as GAP containers, which is how APOTH.SET
 * comes to have 40 gaps among its 192 frame slots.
 *
 * The sixth is not part of the move — when it is there at all. It is the HI-RES
 * STANDING VIEW of the standpoint the transition departs FROM — Titanic's `motionInfo == 2` twin,
 * which v4 stores at the head of a register and v1 stores at the tail of the
 * slot. Three measurements say so and nothing else fits:
 *
 *   - APOTH.SET has exactly 12 containers over 60 KB against ~30 KB for the
 *     rest, and exactly 12 standpoints. Every one of the twelve is the sixth of
 *     some slot.
 *   - each one's coarse colour signature sits 0.5–1.3 from its transition's
 *     DEPARTURE standpoint and 7.5–22.5 from anything else, including its
 *     arrival.
 *   - counting it as part of the move breaks the set: a standpoint's picture is
 *     agreed on by 44/44 arrivals and departures when the run is five, and by
 *     12/44 when it is six. That was a real symptom — a turn ending on a view
 *     of somewhere else entirely.
 *
 * So the run is read by walking the slot to the gaps or to {@link RUN_FRAMES},
 * whichever comes first, and the sixth is handed back separately as
 * {@link V1Transition.departureStill}.

   * and not a pointer. Reading it as the main script only ever worked because
   * the authoring tool wrote the main script into container 1.
   *
   * `undertak.set` is where that stops being true: its container 1 is the ACTOR
   * REGISTER (`actorRegister` names the same index — the only set on the disc
   * where the two collide — and the bytes there are the star record
   * `under.side.side`), so its main script is container 2.

   * — and it sits immediately before {@link C0.setName} at 0x1b7c, which set-open
 * pushes to a string copy two instructions later (`add edi, 0x1b7c`), so the two
 * corroborate each other's placement at the tail of the header.
 *
 * It is kept in the set's own state for the lazy load, exactly as a scene's script
   * is kept at scene+0x18 (the loader is DFPENT.EXE 0x41c1c0, error line 5410).
   * It is also the ONLY offset in the whole 0x1c90-byte header that equals each
   * set's real main-script container across all 35 of them: 2 for undertak.set
   * and 1 for the other 34.
   *
   * Reading 0x1c instead cost that room its entire script. No main means no
   * `openset`, and undertak.set's openset is the only thing in the corpus that
   * ever places the undertaker (`sendtoactor ("side", setupactor ("store"))`),

   * reaching into the slot after it (bounding on the stride alone claimed 957
   * frames twice across the disc, because the blocks do not all start on it); and

  /**
   * Could this container repaint the whole frame?
   *
   * A hi-res still is a KEYFRAME — a slot measures `K d d d d K` — and a ring
   * that opens on anything else decodes it with no base. Two slots on the disc
   * carry a leftover DELTA in the sixth position instead of a still (SALUPPER
   * c307 at 56 bytes, SALLOWER c600 at 104), and taken on faith they put exactly
   * that frame into a turn ring.
   *
   * Two cheap necessary conditions rather than a decode, because the decode costs
   * one full frame per standpoint and TOWN has 208 of them — 900 ms at every
   * arrival in the room you pass through most, against 29 ms for this.
   *
   *   - it must declare the WHOLE viewport. A frame's first two words are its
   *     height and width, and a partial delta declares only the strip it
   *     touches: that is what the two bad slots are, and why a bound on the
   *     frame's own declared height let them through (c307 says three rows and is
   *     56 bytes, which is plenty for three rows).
   *   - and it must be long enough to carry a row header for each of those rows.
   *
   * Both are sound in the direction that matters: neither can reject a frame that
   * really does repaint everything. Either could in principle accept a full-size
   * delta; that the disc contains none is proved the expensive way, by
   * `dust/tools/dustsets.ts`, which decodes every ring frame twice and checks the
   * property itself.

 * SECONDARY star in the record's tail, and the same i16 pointing at the

 * It read as "two coordinates and a name, the rest a fixed tail" for as long as
 * only the primary was wanted, and that cost real stars: `gang.cst` places Leroy
 * on `town.leroy1`, which is not a primary anywhere on the disc — it is the
 * secondary of `town.leroy2`, packed in the tail this reader was skipping. The
 * same skip in the v4 reader is what once kept Sasha from walking down the hall
 * (see `readActors` in set.ts), so the failure and the fix are both the second
 * time round.
 *
 * The tail is NOT zero-filled — every record carries the same f64-looking bytes
