/**
 * MOV files — cutscenes, item close-ups, clickable multi-frame objects.
 * Frames use the SET delta codec (decode in order with a shared FrameBuffer).
 *
 * Playback semantics recovered from TI.EXE's movie interaction loop
 * (fn at 0x449310): a movie is a frame state machine. Each frame's
 * click-region container carries a TYPE word plus optional event/target
 * strings; the same type codes drive both frames (auto-action when the frame
 * has no regions) and regions (action on click):
 *   1 = exit the movie
 *   2 = go to the frame named `target`
 *   3 = exit + chain to the movie named `event`
 *   4 = push (this movie, `target` frame) on the return stack, chain to `event`
 *   5 = pop the return stack and resume there (max depth 5 in the original)
 *   6 = advance one frame            7 = step back one frame
 * A frame WITH regions waits modally for a click; clicks outside all regions
 * do nothing. The i16 at record+6 (an "action" flag in earlier guesses) is
 * never read by the engine. Region coords are Y-first (top,left,bottom,right).
 *
 * A file is a chain of SEGMENTS, not one film. Header +0x2c is the container
 * index of the NEXT segment's header (0 = last), and everything in a segment
 * — palette, frame table, audio tables, cue table, every stored container
 * location — is its own, with locations relative to its header's index. The
 * demo build's movie loop plays them back to back (0x449bb7: exit reloads
 * `[0x488584] = hdr+0x2c` and re-enters setup; every container fetch adds
 * that bias), halting only the event channel between segments; a segment
 * whose loop table has no records (0x44956f) INHERITS the still-playing bed
 * of the one before it. A type-1 "exit" therefore ends the segment, and only
 * the last segment's exit ends the movie. ESC ends the whole chain (state 2
 * clears the next-segment pointer), as does a type-3 chain-out. The demo's
 * TRAILER.MOV is 13 segments (698 frames — the port played 139 and was
 * reported "cut way too soon"), TOUR.MOV is 20 (a narrated slideshow, one
 * segment per slide), and the full game's SINK1..6, LEAVE, DEBRIS and LOGO
 * are multi-segment too.
 *
 * Each segment also carries a CUE table (header +0x68): records of
 * {i32 tick, i32 flags, i32 adjustedTick, pstr(15) frame} that fire ONCE when
 * the segment-relative clock passes `tick` (units of 50/3 ms), jumping
 * playback to the named frame out of ANY wait — a hold, or even a region
 * frame's modal wait (0x44ae90, polled from both wait loops). The stored
 * adjustedTick is `tick - frameBytes*60/((hdr+0x28 || 300)<<10)` — the
 * authored tick minus a CD-streaming lead computed at load (hdr+0x28 is the
 * drive's KB/s); a port with pre-decoded frames wants the authored tick.
 * TOUR.MOV's first segment is the only cue user in any tree: its frame 6 is
 * an authored backward goto (5<->6, the ship's-logo loop) and the cue
 * `tick 200 -> "Name 12"` is what pulls playback out of it 3.33 s in —
 * without it the film sits on the logo forever ("seems to not advance").

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Edits — the write path of the movie editor (editors/movies.html)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Only the LOGIC is editable, and every edit is a copy-on-write patch on one
// container: the frame names and the header fields in the SEGMENT's header
// container, a frame's action and its regions in that frame's own logic
// container.
//
// Every patch below is addressed to a MovSegment, not to the file: a movie is a
// chain of segments and each carries its own header, frame table, palette and
// action-frame slots (see the module comment). These used to hardcode container
// 0, which is only the FIRST segment's header — so an edit made while looking at
// a later segment wrote its frame name into segment 0's table, at the same
// record offset, silently renaming an unrelated frame. `seg.bias` is that
// segment's own header container, and 0 for the first, so a single-segment movie
// patches exactly where it always did.
//
// Frame ART is deliberately NOT editable, and that is a property of the codec
// rather than a missing feature. MOV frames are delta-encoded in ONE chain for
// the whole movie (decodeFrame against a shared FrameBuffer, run in order), so
// replacing frame N leaves frames N+1… decoding their deltas against a picture
// that is no longer there. A SET can do it because its chain unit is a single
// turn ring, self-contained by construction; a movie has no such unit, so a safe
// replacement would mean re-encoding the whole tail self-contained — on a corpus
// where LEAVE.MOV is already 37.5 MB. See taoot/tests/auto/mov-editor.ts, which pins
// the smear rather than just asserting the absence.
