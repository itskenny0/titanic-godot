   *     statements over `blankscore`, moved to the field being rewritten with
   *     `propxy` first, and only THEN `drawstring ("$" @ num, …)`. Both fields
   *     are right-aligned by shifting x by 4 px per missing digit, so the new
   *     value never lands where the old one did and nothing replaced it: #288,
   *     "$100" and "$10" and "$0" all at once in the WAGER box.
   *
   * By RECT and not the whole layer, because the patch is a patch: TAOOT's
   * `messageboxclear` covers x 65..350, y 339..362 of the wireless slip and
   * nothing else on that flat, and Dust's `blankscore` is 60x15 over one of two
   * fields 40 px apart — clearing everything would take the CASH readout with
   * the WAGER one.
   *
   * On the show TRANSITION only. Showing a prop that is already shown
   * composites nothing in the original (nothing is dirty), and a prop being
   * HIDDEN restores the flat under it, which would also wipe text — but no
