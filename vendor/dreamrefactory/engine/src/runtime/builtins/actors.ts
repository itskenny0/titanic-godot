 * of the word: `"resume"` walks the route FROM WHERE YOU ARE.
 *
 * Four steps, in the original's order:
 *
 *  1. find the point nearest the actor (its own truncating integer sqrt, first
 *     minimum wins);
 *  2. if that is the LAST point, take the one before it instead — a route has to

 *     because the first one is a new length nobody authored.
 *
 * Without it a resumed route restarts at its own first point, and since the

 *    (gang.cst 0258 mousedown) threw him back to `hack2` — 4000-odd units up
 *    Scotland Road — before he set off;
 *  - interrupt the walk itself and the same call restarted the route from the
 *    top, so he re-walked the hallway he had already walked.

   *
   * **"Present" means DRAWN, not near** — see {@link ActorRuntime.onScreen} for
   * the gate and for #180, the report that showed the difference. The original
   * does not measure a distance at all: 0x40e790 runs the actor→screen
   * projection and reports the DEPTH it computed, or 32000 where it refused. We
   * keep the ground distance, because the magnitude has no consumer — the only
   * two callers in the whole corpus are `hasattention`, which compares it to
   * 32000 and nothing else, and a `message()` in boot's idle that prints it —
   * and a distance is the number a reader comparing it against `hotdist()`
   * wants. The refusals are what carry the behaviour, and those we follow.
   *
   * **A close-up counts as not present**, and that is the one line of this that
   * isn't geometry. `setVisible` false means the room is not being drawn at all —
   * a stage flat is over it (TAOOT: `cuff.stg`'s chair, `turbine.stg`'s plant,
   * a deck plan) — and the viewer already treats it that way: it passes no camera and no
   * occlusion to the sprite pass while it holds (SetViewer.draw). An actor the
   * camera is not looking at is exactly what the sentinel is for.
   *
   * Which matters because of the ONE caller in the corpus that tests it. gang.cst's
   * `hasattention(seconds)` is how a character accosts you unprompted, and its
   * first branch is `if actordist(target) = 32000 → attentionspan = frame()`:
   * out of sight restarts the clock rather than running it down. Without this,
   * every cast idle keeps counting while you are inside a close-up, and the
   * character walks up and starts a conversation OVER the flat — measured in
   * `recept1c`, where `maxidle` re-arms every 20 ticks and `hasattention(4)` came
   * due while `cuff.stg` was open, leaving the puppet on top of the chair and the
   * flat's own OK unreachable behind it (its script cannot run while the puppet
   * holds the dispatch). Headless the route was simply out of the flat inside
   * four seconds; a browser spends real ones, which is why it only ever showed
   * there — and is what had been read for a while as a dead OK button.
   *
   * A CONVERSATION counts too, and for the same reason — this is where the flat
   * case above was only half the rule. A puppet close-up replaces the world
   * display without touching `setVisible` (only a stage flat clears that), so the
   * cast's idles went on counting down while you were already talking to someone,
   * and `hasattention` came due and accosted you IN the conversation:
   * `sendtoactor(target, mousedown(0))` re-enters the character's mousedown, which
   * runs `walktopuppet` a second time and replays the whole exchange. Reported as
   * every console line arriving twice — `msg: vlad` twice from walktopuppet's own
   * first line, Morrow's ending saying each of its stage directions twice — and it
   * is audible as well as visible, because the second run's `puppetspeak` halts the
   * first's on the shared channel and cuts the line off mid-word.
   *
   * Vlad is the plain case: gang.cst 0960 opens him with `walktopuppet(20, …)`,
   * which unlike the `-1` path never `pauseloop`s the actor, so `vladidle` keeps
   * re-arming every 20 ticks and its `hasattention(4)` fires four seconds in.
   * Morrow's ending is the same shape (0442, `walktopuppet(0, …)`, `hasattention(4)`).
   * FOUR REAL SECONDS is why no headless test has ever seen this and a person
   * always does — the same reason the `cuff.stg` case above only ever showed in a
   * browser.
   *
   * The FLAT half is verified against TI.EXE (2026-08-07). The handler
   * (0x40e790) answers 0x7d00 = 32000 whenever the shared actor→screen
   * projection (0x411180) refuses, and its gates are: actorvisible ≤ 0, no set
   * open (0x489f58), the setvisible global zero (0x489f5a — its only writer in
   * .text is setvisible's own handler, 0x408821), a scene mismatch, or the
   * projection failing. TAOOT's BOOTFILE 0002 calls setvisible(false) for every
   * stage flat it opens over a set, so through a flat the original answers
   * 32000 through exactly this chain — and its accost machinery does run under
   * a flat (boot's idle() calls forceupdate() every pass, which is the loop
   * service), so the sentinel is what shields it there too.
   *
   * The PUPPET branch is ours; the original gets the same observable by
   * starvation. Its loop table is serviced only via forceupdate/visualeffect
   * (jmp 0x43e3ea / call 0x43df8f are the only entries into 0x442550), a
   * conversation holds the script dispatch, and puppetspeak's wait (0x43f840)
   * pumps ticks without servicing loops — so no idle ever runs to ask the
   * question. Our tick loop keeps running through a conversation, so the ask
   * happens here and must get the not-present answer. hasattention is the only
   * caller of actordist in the shipped corpus, so no script can tell the two
   * mechanisms apart.
