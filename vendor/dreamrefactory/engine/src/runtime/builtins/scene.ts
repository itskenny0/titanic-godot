   * should look like, so it cancels a movie's pending reveal — see
   * {@link GameSession.tickFade}.
   *
   * Blocking is the part that was missing, and it is not a detail. In TI.EXE
   * both are a linear lerp between the named surface's palette and the black
   * one, `steps` increments, and the loop (`0x435b90` / `0x435be0`, reached
   * through `0x43e550` / `0x43e5d0`) BUSY-WAITS one 60 Hz tick per step on the
   * engine's own clock (`0x41de90`, `timeGetTime() * 3 / 50`) with no message
   * pump and no scheduler pass inside it. The interpreter is frozen for the
   * whole ramp, so the statement AFTER a fade cannot run until the fade is over.
   *
   * Ours queued the ramp and returned, and the game noticed. `gang.cst`'s
   * `prepuppet` is `screentoblack("current", 10)`, `openpuppetfile`,
   * `visualeffect(plain, 0)`, `blacktoscreen("puppet", 10)` — and only then does
   * `runpuppet` send the puppet its boot script, which is what speaks the first
   * line. With the fade non-blocking the line started while the screen was still
   * black and rode the ramp up: #6, "actors begin speaking before fade-in".
   *
   * Sleeping the script tick (the same unit and the same primitive `delay(n)`
   * uses) rather than awaiting the queue: the ramp advances one step per tick
   * from the tick it is pushed on, so `steps` ticks is always long enough, and a
   * ramp that is somehow starved cannot wedge the script behind it forever.
   *
   * And blocking is conditional on a frame source, on exactly the test
   * `playmovie` below uses and for exactly its reason: a host that does not
   * advance the clock never ticks the ramp, so awaiting one would deadlock on
   * the first transition. A bare `GameSession` is that host — several savegame
   * tests drive the game's own `transtoflat` with no viewer attached and clear
   * `fade.queue` by hand afterwards — and there the fades stay what they were,
   * a level set and nothing waited on.
