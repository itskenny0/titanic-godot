   * prophide(name, flag) — suppress a prop's drawing without disturbing whether
   * a script thinks it is visible.
   *
   * `"all"` is a BROADCAST of that per-prop flag, not a latch of one global —
   * and it is the only form the three corpora use. Timelapse's BOOTFILE wraps a
   * transition in `HideVisibleProps` / `ShowVisibleProps`, which are one
   * `prophide("all", true)` and one `prophide("all", false)`, so the compass and
   * the carried inventory item do not sit over a picture being swapped
   * underneath them.
   *
   * Two flags rather than one, and {@link PropInstance.hidden} has the reason:
   * "show the props that were visible" is only answerable if hiding never wrote
   * `visible` in the first place. The named form is here for symmetry with the
   * opcode's signature and has no call site on any of the three discs.
   *
   * ## Why hiding is per-prop, and only of what is VISIBLE
   *
   * The handler's own name says it — `HideVisibleProps` — and the interface is
   * where the difference shows. `begininterface` hides, and then never shows
   * again before handing over:
   *
   *     HideVisibleProps ()          / / prophide ("all", true)
   *     …
   *     openstagefile ("P.Stg")
   *     sendtoflat (currentflat (), openflatx ())
   *
   * and that `openflatx` is the panel building its own controls:
   * `propvisible ("slider", true)`, `propxy ("slider", 442 - turnframerate,
   * 215)`, `propvisible ("volume", true)`, `propdeg ("volume", wavevolume ())`.
   * `ShowVisibleProps` is not called until `endinterface`, on the way out. So a
   * single global latched across that span suppressed the panel's OWN props for
   * exactly as long as the panel was open: the volume dial and the two slider
   * knobs were never drawn, and `propAt` never saw them either, so the drag
   * loops in `P.Shp` (`while stilldown () … propxy (me, xloc, 215)`) could not
   * start. Reported from play as the sound settings doing nothing — the coarse
   * region handlers behind the knobs still worked, so clicking an icon jammed
   * the level to maximum and nothing was draggable.
   *
   * Broadcasting to what is visible NOW is what makes both halves true: the
   * compass and the carried item are visible when the transition starts, so they
   * are hidden; the panel's slider is `propvisible (…, false)` at that instant
   * (`endinterface` put it away last time), so it is untouched and comes back
   * the moment `openflatx` shows it.

   * `propset(name, set)` says which SET a prop belongs to — and belonging to a

   * The port stored the name and nothing else, and the set filter that reads it
   * lives in {@link PropRuntime.worldDrawList} — which a screen-space prop never
   * reaches. So a prop that had been assigned to a room but not yet positioned
   * stayed in the SCREEN draw list, pinned at the default anchor (256, 192) and
   * drawn over every room in the game. #290 is that, reported from the Mayor's
   * spare room on the morning of day 2: a pile of dung, a tumbleweed and a vase
   * of flowers stacked in mid-air at the centre of the view, unchanged by turning
   * or walking, and clickable.
   *
   * The corpora say the two are the same statement. All 94 `propset` calls in
   * Dust and all 27 in Titanic are about world props — every one is within a few
   * lines of a `propxyz`, `propstar`, `makecricket` or a `propscale` in the
   * thousands — and Dust is the game that leans on the ORDER:
   *
   *     code setupprop (where)            / / HOUSE.PRP, the dung
   *         if where = "town"
   *             propset (me, "town")
   *             propvisible (me, true)
   *             propscale (me, 500)
   *             propdeg (me, random (255))
   *
   * with the position arriving later and from somewhere else — `randomloc()` when
   * the town opens, `movestar()` for the shooting star, a `makecricket` for the
   * shooting-range bullet. Titanic always places first and calls `propset` after
   * (`propstar (me, "flames")` then `propset (me, "smoke")`), which is why this
   * costs it nothing: by the time propset runs there, the prop is already a world
   * prop.
   *
   * `propdeg (me, random (255))` is the same fact said twice: 0..255 is an
   * ORIENTATION, which is only meaningful for a prop drawn against a camera —
   * screen-space props read propdeg as a frame index (see the note there).
   *
   * An empty name is not an assignment and does not move a prop into the world;
   * `propxy` still takes it back out, so a script that places a prop on the
   * screen after assigning it to a set gets what it asked for, in that order.

     * A star the open set has never heard of, which in Dust is the ordinary
     * case: its star names are qualified by set — the identifiers in the SET
     * itself are `town.flower`, `town.jug`, `town.bone` — and the scripts that
     * place these props run wherever the player happens to be. `INVEN.PRP`'s
     * `initprops` is the one #290 caught: on the morning of day 2 it does
     * `sendtoprop ("flowers", setupprop ("grave"))`, whose body is `propset (me,
     * "town")` and `propstar (me, "town.flower")`, and the player is asleep in
     * `mayroom` — so the star misses and the vase had no position at all.
     *
     * The answer is the one {@link ActorRuntime.settleStars} already gives for
     * the cast, for the same reason and with the same restraint: remember that
     * this one MISSED, and seat it when its own set opens. A prop is only ever
     * drawn in its own set, so a position is only required to be right by the
     * time that set is the one being looked at.
     *
     * Qualified names only. Titanic reaches this branch with bare names that are
     * simply not stars — `propstar` doubles as a store for placement sentinels
     * there, the way `actorstar` does — and those must not be waiting for a set
     * called after them.
