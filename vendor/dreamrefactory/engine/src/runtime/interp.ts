   *    boot2's openset (setupsound) was skipped — a silent room on the wrong
   *    theme. {@link SetScripts.fireLifecycle} worked around it locally by
   *    ignoring this flag and reading the handler's own signal instead.
   *  - `STAIR2C.SET`'s keydown rung calls `setupshayhack()` / `setupcsea()`
   *    before its `passcode`, and both end in `exitcode`. The rung passcoded
   *    correctly, but this flag was already set, so the engine default move —
   *    the walk that carries you up out of View15 — never ran. The 2nd-class
   *    staircase could not be climbed past C deck, which is what made the
   *    turbine room a one-way trip and the segment that went there a leaf
   *    (docs/taoot/verification.md).
   *
   * So the test is by NAME against the event under dispatch, which keeps the
   * one case that must still consume: boot1's keydown routes the same event on
   * with `sendtoscene(currentscene(), keydown(arg))`, and a set keydown that
   * exitcodes there is overriding the default move on purpose. Same name, same
