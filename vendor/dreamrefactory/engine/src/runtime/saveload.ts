/**
 * Saving and loading `.ti` games, at the session level.
 *
 * Loading RESTORES the engine from the file, the way the original does: TI.EXE's
 * `opengame` (0x413860 → 0x414080) rebuilds the room through the engine's own
 * set machinery without ever reaching the script runners — `openset` and
 * `openscene` do not run on a load at all (#143, traced in the disassembly).
 * Everything those scripts would re-derive comes out of the file instead: the
 * cast (placement, scale, visibility), every prop's owner/view/position/z-order,
 * the live `makeloop`/`makecricket` tables, and the playing theme.
 *
 * Writing reproduces bytes by PATCHING a real save (the last one loaded, or a
 * shipped template) rather than serializing from scratch — see
 * docs/engine/formats/savegame.md for why. The df/savegame.ts layer owns the byte
 * format (generic: every DreamFactory title's `.ti` shares it); this module owns
 * what the running game puts in and takes out, and THAT part is TAOOT-specific
 * by nature — which actor/prop owners are player state is a fact about TAOOT's
 * own scripts, not something the format declares. A second title's save story
 * would need its own actorSnapshot/inventorySnapshot.

 * The save says so itself. `setpath` mounts its volume by label —
 * `currentcd("Titanic2")` — and that label is the first thing in the file
 * (container 0 @256, {@link SaveGame.disk}); the original's own loader restores
 * the whole resource path table with it, `titanic2:data:` and all, which is

 *
 * What it looked like: the vestibule door out of `veststbd` view18 (#231). Disc
 * 2's copy of that room sends you to `deckbd scene36/view110`, the promenade
 * outside the door; disc 1's older copy still names `scene379`, a scene deckbd
 * does not have — and an unresolvable scene falls back to the set's FIRST, which
 * in deckbd is the `Scene30` stub whose whole openscene is
 * `gotospecial ("decka", "scene354", "view357")`. So the player was handed
 * straight through the boat deck and out the other side onto A deck, having been
 * in deckbd for one frame. (Both engines fall back the same way — TI.EXE's scene

   *
   * Normally that silence is a room's own doing and the room cleans up after
   * itself: `dumpglobal` (interp.ts) discards a room's globals from `closeset`
   * or `closestage`, and all 64 sites in the corpus sit in a teardown. A load

   * `frame() - jonesframe > 2000 & jonesphase = 0`, and `jonesframe` is never
   * initialised anywhere — it springs into existence the first time the offer
   * fires. So 101 of the 109 shipped saves have no record for it (the 8 that do
   * are ENDGAME2 saves taken after it fired), and `session.frameCounter =

   * measured at frame 38365 against a jonesframe of 337079, the gate's
   * difference is -298714 and it reopens after 300714 more frames, which is
   * five and a half hours of play. `jonesphase` restores from the file and looks
   * innocent, which is why the report named the flag and not the stamp.
   *
   * Deleted rather than zeroed: a `global` declaration recreates a missing name
   * at 0 (interp.ts), which is exactly what the original hands a script reading
   * a variable its restored list has no node for.
   *
   * ## What this is safe against
   *
   * The port's own saves are a PATCH onto a shipped base, and a base has only so
   * many free variable slots — so in principle a checkpoint can be silent about a
   * global merely because it did not fit, and deleting that would lose live
   * state. Measured, it does not happen: the corpus knows 163 distinct globals
   * between all 109 saves and the roomiest base holds 139, but no single session
   * ever holds 163. Restoring each shipped save into a session and writing a
   * checkpoint from it onto the roomiest base drops NOTHING in any of them — the
   * live count runs 85..127 against that 139. And a global that did not fit is
   * already reported at the moment it is written, loudly and by name, rather
   * than left to be discovered later (see snapshotSave's `onDrop`).
   *
   * `__`-prefixed names are the port's own bookkeeping and not game state, so
   * they are not the file's to speak for: `__propsinit` is a once-guard on
   * TAOOT's inven.shp initprops and a load must not re-arm it. snapshotSave

   * ...AND THE CONVERSATION, if one is open.
   *
   * #254: loaded a Turbine Room checkpoint from the middle of a conversation
   * with the Gorse-Joneses and they came along for the ride. A conversation is
   * SESSION state — `SetViewer.conversing` is `session.puppet?.visible` and
   * nothing more — so it does not belong to the room being left and rebuilding
   * the viewer does not shake it off. Nothing here used to clear it, and the
   * close-up stayed on screen over whatever room the file named.
   *
   * The engine's own load lever cannot reach this, which is why it went unseen:
   * `opengame` is the CTL panel's, and you cannot open the CTL panel with a
   * conversation up. The workbench's checkpoint chips call the host's load
   * directly and at any moment (taoot/src/speedrun-page.ts), so they can.
   *
   * `closePuppetFile` answers the script's pending `puppetevent` with -1 — the
   * same "nothing was chosen" a plaque's ESC gives — so the conversation script
   * unwinds instead of waiting for a bevel nobody will ever press. NOT preceded
   * by a `settle()`, unlike prepareRestart's teardown: the workbench loads
   * inside `session.track(...)`, so a load that awaited the in-flight dispatches
   * would be waiting for itself (the same trap host.ts records for `restart`).

   * screen the wipe started on, and it keeps being drawn over whatever is
   * underneath until the animation runs out — so a load taken mid-wipe paints
   * the room it came from across the room it went to.
   *
   * The ending is where this is reachable, because the ending is made of wipes:
   * narend.stg's scrapbook turns every one of its pages with
   * `visualeffect(wipeleft, 30)` (see the corpus quoted in builtins/scene.ts),

 * manifest and drops the rest, and ours accumulates (the load in #199 still had
 * the London flat's bedsit1/bedrad1 mounted). Inert, and its own question.

 * (`save.theme.extras`, e.g. the smokestack maze's wind — the maze re-arms them
