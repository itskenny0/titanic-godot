   * `turntodeg`: turn an actor to face a bearing, over time.
   *
   * A turn is a WALK in the original — `0x443550` builds a record in the same
   * table `iswalk` answers from, with the same shape a straight walk gets: the
   * facing target at `+8` (this port's `turnTo`), the actor's current position,
   * and `+0x3e` copied from the actor's CURRENT star (`actor+0x70`), so a turn
   * does not change where anyone is going. Only the mode differs — 0 here
   * against `walkonpath`'s 3.
   *
   * That is load-bearing for conversations, because `walktopuppet` (gang.cst 0001)
   * waits on exactly that:
   *
   *     pauseloop ("actor", who, true)
   *     turntodeg (who, calcdeg (actorxyz (who, 4), cameraxyz (4)))
   *     while iswalk (who)  forceupdate ()  endwhile
   *     runpuppet (pupname, pupmessage)
   *
   * Setting the facing outright — which is what this did — left `iswalk` false,
   * so the wait never spun and `runpuppet` opened in the same breath: Zeitel took
   * your approach in the first-class lounge without ever turning round, and the
   * conversation began with his back to you (#124). 86 calls in the corpus reach
   * here, most of them an idle loop facing the player.
   *
   * A turn to the facing the actor ALREADY has records nothing. That is what keeps
   * the idles convergent: a completed turn fires `endwalk`, whose handlers re-arm
   * the idle (`zeitidle`), which turns again — and the second turn asks for a
   * bearing already held, so it stops there instead of recurring.

       *
       * Which is a save-breaking answer, because of who asks. GANG.CST's
       * `walktopuppet` opens a conversation by memorising where the character
       * was going so it can send them back afterwards —

       * the player is within `hotdist`, every 21 service steps, all conversation
       * long. Click a character during one of those turns — likelier the moment
       * you walk up to them, since the turn then has 128 units to cover — and
       * `savestar` was `"custom"`, so the walk home was `walktostar (me,
       * "custom")`: not found, no walk, no arrival, no `endwalk`. The character
       * stands where they met you with `"custom"` in `actorstar` and no idle loop

   * Silence any cricket whose set is not the one on screen.

   * once, in its BOOTFILE `initall`. So every path that leaves a set WITHOUT
   * initall left its ambience sounding, positioned in a world that is no longer
   * on screen.
   *
   * TAOOT's `advanceday` endgame arm is that path: it calls `closesetfile()` and
   * goes straight into the flats, so the boat deck's five `party` crowd loops
   * (EXTRA.CST `crowdcrickets`, one per lifeboat star) talked through leave.mov,
   * debris.mov, the closing narration and prozac.mov. Measured in
   * taoot/tests/browser/endgame.ts: `crickets=[party1..party5]` on every sample from
   * the deck to the credits, with `cricket.sfx` already closed — they could no
   * longer re-fire, they simply never stopped. The re-fire guard below has
   * always skipped them; only the audio was missing from it.
   *
   * The handle is dropped as well as stopped, so coming back to the set starts
   * the ambience again rather than being blocked by a play that is still "not
   * done". Re-arming is unaffected: a cricket in another set never reaches the
   * loop body, and the loop ambients all have `jitter 0`, which draws no RNG.
   *
   * Called from the service pass AND from `session.currentSetName`'s setter — the
   * setter is what makes it immediate, which the endgame needs: it closes the set
   * and starts a movie in the same script, and game time stops for the movie.
