     *
     * `screentoblack(name, steps)` ramps a named CLUT to black — the port models
     * it as a level over the whole screen — and the name Timelapse hands it is
     * `curclutname`, which over a stage is `"stage"`. Replacing the stage file
     * replaces that palette, so a ramp against the OLD stage's cannot survive
     * into the new one; there is nothing left for it to be a ramp of.
     *
     * The interface panel is what needs this said out loud. `begininterface` is
     * `screentoblack (curclutname, 10)`, `closestagefile ()`, `openstagefile
     * ("P.Stg")`, `gotoflat (coder)`, `visualeffect (plain, 0)` — and then the
     * arriving flat's own `openflatx`. Three of the four panel flats end that
     * with `blacktoscreen`, and the PHOTO ALBUM (flat 3, container 32) does not:
     * its `openflatx` checks the film count and arms `makeloop ("flat", me,
     * "updateflat", 2)`, nothing more. So a level that outlived the stage swap
     * left the album's caption, its furniture and the photograph itself painted
     * correctly into a framebuffer nobody could see — reported from play as the
     * album being a black screen.
     *
     * `blacktoscreen` still ramps, because it reveals FROM black by definition —
     * see the note on it in builtins/scene.ts.
     *
     * ## HERE, and not before the bytes (#308)
     *
     * The clear used to be the first thing this method did, above `ensureFile` —
     * and the justification for it, that the palette it ramped against is gone,
     * is only true once the replacement is actually in hand. In TI.EXE the
     * distinction cannot arise: `openstagefile` reads the file with the
     * interpreter blocked inside it, nothing repaints, and the screen is still
     * the black `screentoblack` left until the new stage draws. Ours awaits a
     * NETWORK FETCH there, with the rAF loop compositing throughout — so
     * lifting the black first handed the screen back to `world` for the whole
     * download. First open of the map and of the save panel: fade to black, the
     * room you left painted over it again for as long as `p.stg` took to arrive,
     * then a snap back to black for `blacktoscreen` to ramp out of.
     *
     * And the post-movie hold (`fade.pendingReveal`, see ScreenDirector.
     * screenOwner) is not this method's to end at all. Opening a stage file is
     * not a script saying what the screen should look like; the four statements
     * that ARE end it, and `tickFade` lifts it when the script falls quiet.
     * TAOOT's boot is what that cost: `playmode.mov` ends, and the cast, four
     * shops and `main.stg` load before `advanceday` reaches `datebed.mov` with
     * no screen statement in between. `main.stg` is in that window, so ending
     * the hold there lit the apartment up — through `bedsit1.set`'s own load and
     * on until the date caption started — which is exactly the flash #209 was
     * about, one stage swap further along.
     *
     * ## …unless the script BLANKED the screen (#308 again)
     *
     * A ramp is the only black this may lift, because a ramp is the only black
     * that belongs to the palette being replaced. `blackscreen()` is the
     * framebuffer — see GameSession.fade.blanked — and a stage swap draws
     * nothing over it, so it stands.
     *
     * The painting crate is the sighting. `binl.set`'s crate is
     * `transtoflat("cargo.stg")`, and that arm of the boot's `transtoflat` ends
     * on a FILM rather than a fade: `screentoblack`, `blackscreen`,
     * `closestagefile`, `openstagefile("cargo.stg")`, `sendtostage(opencargo())`,
     * `setvisible(false)`, `playmovie("cratep.mov")`. Nothing between the swap
     * and the clip says what the screen should look like — the clip IS the
     * reveal — so lifting the black here painted the arriving flat, which is the
     * open crate with the painting in it, and left it up for the whole 648 KB of
     * `cratep.mov`: measured at 75 frames, one and a quarter seconds of the end
     * of the animation before the animation. The trunk and the Enigma machine
     * are the same three lines with their own clip.
     *
     * Held with `pendingReveal` rather than by leaving the level alone, and that
     * is what makes it safe rather than a black nobody can lift: the flag already
     * means "the screen is black and nobody has said what comes next", and
     * `tickFade` lifts it the moment the script falls quiet. Every arm of that
     * switch is then covered — the three that end on a clip by the clip, the
     * darkroom's `mixclut("stage", "black", 0, 255, 245)` by the palette install
     * (ScreenDirector.setClut reveals a clut on the surface being shown), the
     * rest by their own `blacktoscreen` — and anything that ends on none of them
     * by the quiet.

   * come through here rather than through a second stage load.

  /**
   * What a VARIANT flat's delta is authored against: the variant before it.
   *
   * Timelapse names a flat `i{region}.{frame}` and a variant of one
   * `i{region}.{frame}.{n}` — three components, not two — and those variants are
   * a CHAIN: `.1` is a delta over the base picture, `.2` over `.1`, and an
   * animation run walks `.2 … .54` the same way. Seeding from the flat that was
   * on screen (see below) is right for a run, because a run is walked in order
   * and the previous cel IS what you arrived from. It is wrong the moment a
   * script JUMPS into the middle of a chain, and Timelapse does that on purpose.
   *
   * The lantern's instruction sheet is the worked example, and it was reported:
   * the table flat `i0001.605` carries a `LanternInst` region whose mousedown is
   *
   *     if gHasMatches = 0 & gLanternLit = 0
   *         gotoflat ("i0001.605.1")     ← the sheet, matchbox still on it
   *     else
   *         gotoflat ("i0001.605.2")     ← the sheet, matchbox gone
   *
   * so once the player has taken the matches the game jumps straight from the
   * TABLE to `.2`. Decoded over the table, `.2` changes 4,771 pixels of it and
   * leaves the other 302,429 — the player clicks the instructions and gets the
   * table back, which is exactly what the screenshot showed. Decoded over `.1`
   * (itself decoded over the base) it is the sheet, and matches the shipped art
   * to the pixel.
   *
   * Recursive, and the cache is what makes that cheap: walking an animation
   * forward finds its predecessor already decoded, and a cold jump into `.28`
   * builds the 28 it needs once. Returns null for anything that is not a variant,
   * or whose predecessor is not in this stage, so a two-component flat keeps the
   * behaviour below.

         * `engine/src/df/image.ts` says so at the top: "several row modes / run

         *
         * It never showed on the first two games because neither animates a
         * stage: their flats are all whole pictures, and a whole picture writes
         * every pixel, so what the buffer held first cannot matter. Timelapse
         * animates 156 stages this way — its BOOTFILE calls them "flat delta
         * animation handlers" in a comment — and `flatstartanim(2, 54, …)` walks
         * `i0001.100.2 … .54` as deltas over the shot they belong to. Decoded
         * cold, only the pixels that CHANGED had a value and the rest came out
         * index 0: the birds took off over a black rectangle.
         *
         * Seeding from the OUTGOING flat rather than tracking runs explicitly is
         * what keeps this safe for the other two: a keyframe overwrites the seed
         * completely, so it renders identically whatever was underneath, and only
         * art that deliberately leaves pixels alone can tell the difference.
