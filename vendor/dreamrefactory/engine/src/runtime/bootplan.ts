/**
 * What a game's own boot needs, read out of its BOOTFILE.
 *
 * The host has to know two things before it can start a DreamFactory game over
 * HTTP: which files to have in hand so `boot()` never waits mid-sequence, and
 * which room the boot ends up in. Both used to be hardcoded lists of TAOOT
 * filenames — `bedsit1.set`, `logo.mov`, `gang.cst`, `house.shp`, sixteen of them
 * — which is knowledge about one game sitting in the layer that runs any of them.
 * The 1996 demo shares four of those names and needs a fifth the list had never
 * heard of, and a different CyberFlix title would share almost none.
 *
 * So they are read instead. Every one of those files is named, as a string
 * literal, by the boot's own scripts:
 *
 *   opencastfile ("gang.cst")      openshopfile ("house.shp")
 *   opentrackfile ("unilib.trk")   openstagefile ("main.stg")
 *   playmovie ("logo.mov")         initall ("bedsit1")
 *
 * — so the BOOTFILE is the manifest, and this module reads it.
 *
 * ## Where the walk stops, and why
 *
 * The scan follows calls out of `boot()` through the boot library, which is what
 * catches a resource the entry point opens indirectly (the demo's `boot()` ends in
 * `menuscreen()`, and *that* is what opens `demo.stg`).
 *
 * It stops at the {@link DAY_MACHINE} handlers. That boundary is not a
 * convenience — `boot()` ends with `sendtostage(advanceday())`, so a walk that
 * followed it would run on into the entire story: the full game's `advanceday`
 * names `ocredits.mov`, `leave.mov` and `credits.mov`, 85 MB of endgame that a
 * player five seconds into a launch must not be waiting for. It is also exactly
 * the split the host already works to — `GameHost.coldBoot` runs `boot()` and then
 * kicks the day advance itself, because that closing `sendtostage` cannot reach
 * the boot library — so the plan divides where the host divides: `resources` is
 * what the boot needs, {@link BootPlan.landingSet} is where the day machine goes.
 *
 * Those two handler names and `boot` are the only names left in here. That is the
 * whole of what this layer now knows about any particular game.

 * and it is what calls `currentscene("strait"/"left"/"right")` — the code that
 * actually moves you. Timelapse duplicates `mousedown` the same way.
 *
 * The runtime never had this wrong: `GameSession` keeps `bootScripts` as a list
 * and builds passcode chains across all of them, so both halves are reachable.
 * But this is a RESOURCE SCAN, and a scan that stops at the first definition
 * cannot see what a later one opens. Visiting all of them removes the tie-break
