/**
 * Saving and loading a Dust game: what the session puts into a `.rtd` and takes
 * out of one.
 *
 * *Prerequisite: [`../df/savegame-v1.ts`](../df/savegame-v1.ts), the byte format,
 * and [`saveload.ts`](saveload.ts), the same two halves for Titanic.*
 *
 * The division of labour is the play page's: the format module knows the bytes
 * and nothing about a session, this one knows the session and asks the format
 * module for the bytes. And the CHOREOGRAPHY is the play page's too — reset the
 * timed world, apply the file's records with the script runners muted, then
 * arrive through the engine's own set machinery — because that sequence is not
 * about Titanic. It is about what a load is: the room you arrive in was never
 * entered, so nothing re-derives anything and the file has to carry the screen.
 *
 * What is genuinely different is the two ends:
 *
 *  - **where you are.** A `.ti` names the scene and the view; a `.rtd` gives a
 *    grid cell and one of four facings, which is how Dust's SET addresses a
 *    standpoint in the first place. So the cell is resolved against the set's own
 *    scene table to get the name the engine wants ({@link sceneAtCell}).
 *  - **what a record holds.** v1's cast record is four bytes longer than v4's and
 *    its numeric tail is not mapped, so the fields this port does not know are
 *    filled from the LIVE object rather than guessed at — a restore then leaves
 *    them exactly as the running game had them instead of zeroing them. See
 *    {@link asV4Actor}.
 *
 * There is no disc to mount (Dust is one CD), no cast crowd to re-instance from
 * a numbered source, and no track containers to reopen — Dust's ambience is one
 * looping bank chunk, recorded in container 0 and in the `loopsound` global
 * alike, and the room's own scene loop restarts it.

/**
 * The sound: the banks the save had open, and the loop that was sounding out of
 * one of them.
 *
 * The v1 loader restored neither, and both halves were audible. Reported as
 * "loading a game does not restore the playing theme": load `D1E_002` in DUST.EXE
 * and the saloon theme is there at once, load it here and the saloon was silent.
 *
 * ## The banks come first, and not only for the theme
 *
 * A load re-arms the scheduler from the file and runs no `openset` (see the note
 * on GameSession.restoringSave), so the room's ambience comes back as a restored
 * LOOP — `D1E_001` carries `scene:scene g14.nightfxs`, which is NITE.SET's night
 * chorus: it picks a sound by distance, `soundloop`s it and fires the occasional
 * owl, distant dog or coyote over the top. Every one of those is an identifier in
 * a bank, and with no bank open `singlesound` had nothing to find. That is why
 * the night was completely silent and not merely music-less.
 *
 * ## Which bank is "town.snd"
 *
 * `NIGHT.SND` calls itself `town.snd`, exactly as `TOWN.SND` does — DF.EXE's
 * banks are named twice and the scripts use both names (AudioLibrary.find) —
 * and NITE.SET's `openset` is `opentrackfile ("night.snd")`, `playtheme
 * ("town.snd")`. So the save's bank LIST, which holds those inside names, says
 * "town.snd" for a night game, and opening a file by that name would fetch the
 * daylight bank: no owl, no night wind, and a day theme under a night sky.
 *
 * The theme record's words are handles into the open-file manifest, so they name
 * the FILE. Opening that first and then skipping any listed name the open banks
 * already answer to is what puts `D1E_001` back with exactly the two banks it
 * was saved with, `night.snd` and `unilib.snd`.
 *
 * ## What is not restored, and said
 *
 * The third word, and it is NOT a hole in this. It is an index into the loop that
 * was sounding — not a container location of one: `D1E_002` carries 6 against
 * `saloon2.snd`, whose seven loop chunks are `newrag 1`..`newrag 7` at locations
 * 8..14, while location 6 there is a one-shot crowd yell. Nothing resumes from
 * it: DF.EXE restarts the loop from its beginning on a load (checked in the
 * original — `D1E_002` comes back with the ragtime from the top), and the port
 * plays a bank's loop chunks as one concatenation (AudioLibrary.theme) and does
 * the same. The word is recorded and unused on both sides.
 *
 * What IS missing is neither of those:
 *
 *   - a bank with NO loop chunks cannot be resumed at all. `D2M_004` is one
 *     (`mayor.snd`, the hall clock), and it loads silent with a line saying so.
 *   - `currenttheme (1)` is the name of the chunk sounding NOW, which a script
 *     reads while the loop RUNS — `if currenttheme (1) != "nightwind3"` is what
 *     gates NITE.SET's random owl and coyote — and a single concatenated buffer
 *     cannot answer it. Nothing to do with loading; its own fix.

   * The point of no return, and the first thing past it: stop the scripts the

   *
   * A suspended script is suspended INSIDE a builtin, and the teardown below
   * releases exactly those — `scheduler.reset()`, `puppetCtrl.closePuppetFile()`,
   * `endWipe()`, `onAbandonMovie`. Released and not stopped, a script runs its
   * next statement in a game that no longer exists, reading the globals the load
   * has just replaced. On the Titanic side that was the reported symptom: the
   * ending's straight-line script resumed at the next film after a checkpoint
   * load and reached its `if mission = "good"` branch holding the checkpoint's
   * mission, so the good ending finished on the bad ending's restart screen.
   *
   * Before the teardown, not after, so nothing is ever woken into the gap. The
   * epoch machinery is `Interpreter.abandonRunning()` — every `Frame` carries the
   * epoch it was made in and `execBlock` checks it before each statement, so a
   * frame from the previous game unwinds at its next statement and its dispatch
   * promise resolves. Frames made after the bump carry the new epoch and are
   * untouched, which is why the load's own scripts are not affected.
   *
   * Dust's lever is a button on the inventory panel rather than TAOOT's control
   * panel, so the caller's tail is worth reading before assuming the abandon is
   * free. There are two, both `mousedown` in `NEW.FLT`, and the abandon reaches
   * both of them — they are frames of the epoch it just closed.
   *
   *     0034:  opengame ("dust 0.3")                                  <- nothing after

   *            endif
   *
   * 0025's tail is a no-op on the path that reaches it: a load that got this far
   * has already run `gotoFlat(PLAY_FLAT)` below, so `currentflat ()` is the play
   * flat and the `if` is false. Skipping it and running it come to the same

   * `df/savegame-v1.ts` shares `save-vars.ts` with v4, "the variable list both
   * versions share". A global with no record did not exist when the game was
   * saved, and after `opengame` it should not exist either. Normally a room
   * cleans up after itself with `dumpglobal` from a teardown, but a load runs no
   * scripts, so nothing is dumped and the abandoned game's value stands under a
   * file that never mentioned it.
   *
   * Measured over the 56 shipped `.RTD`s: 170 distinct globals between them, 79
   * carried by some and not others — the blackjack and poker tables, the fight,

   * save from before a puzzle was touched left that puzzle's live state standing
   * underneath it.
   *
   * The sharper edge is the frame stamps. `session.frameCounter` is set from the
   * file below, and the game reads a stamp only as `frame() - stamp`; shipped
   * counters span 4885 to 261166, so a stamp that survives a load while the
   * counter rewinds under it goes negative and stays there. Dust's own
   * `attentionspan` is carried by all 56 and is safe by luck — the same luck

   * reported.
   *
   * Deleted rather than zeroed: a `global` declaration recreates a missing name
   * at 0, which is what the original hands a script reading a variable its
   * restored list has no node for. `__` names are the port's own bookkeeping and
   * not the file's to speak for — `snapshotSaveV1` skips the same prefix writing.
   *

   * are small and it used to drop what would not fit, which meant a file could
   * be silent about a global that DID exist — 164 of them over the playthrough,
   * `handitem` among them. Deleting on top of that would have turned every one

     *
     * A patch field left `undefined` keeps the base save's value (every write in
     * `applyPatchV1` is guarded), and that is the whole design of this list.
     *
     * This port does not model everything a record holds, and where it does not,
     * its own default is not a decision — it is an absence. Writing those
     * absences over a real save is what a port save did to the original:
     * measured against the base it was patched from, 73 of 73 prop records and
     * 40 of 54 cast records came out worse —
     *
     *     avatar     scale 1000 -> 0        the panel portrait, at no size
     *     slider     screen (117,323) -> (256,192)   into the middle of the room
     *     inven day  view "base" -> ""     no state to pick a sprite from
     *     Jug        dist 148 -> 0
     *     Mwife      scale 1000 -> 0, speed 4 -> 0   (she loaded hovering)
     *     Help       set "town" -> "", star "walktostar" -> "", x 1732 -> 0
     *
     * So each field below is written only where the port has a positive value
     * for it: a scale it was given, an anchor a script placed (`screenPlaced`),
     * a name a script set, a world position for something actually in the world.
     * The rest is the base's, which is the only other thing it could truthfully
     * be.
     *
     * The map's KEY is the prop's name — a PropInstance does not carry it, the
     * same reason the play page's snapshot destructures the entry.
