/**
 * A playthrough's observable state, sampled at a story beat.
 *
 * The point of this is to make a scripted playthrough assert itself. The plot
 * lives entirely in script globals (see docs/taoot/mission-flow.md) — `mission`,
 * `phase`, and ~140 sub-plot state machines — so a snapshot of the globals
 * table plus the room you're standing in and who owns what IS the game state.
 * Record it once per beat, diff a later run against the recording, and a
 * divergence points at the beat that caused it instead of surfacing three
 * missions later as a missing door.
 *
 * That's the difference between authoring a playthrough as inputs (a click
 * route, which is short) and as expectations (a per-step assertion list, which
 * is not).
 *
 * The same function serves the headless run and the browser one — main.ts
 * exposes it on `dbg` — so the two traces are comparable by construction
 * rather than by two hand-written snapshotters agreeing.
